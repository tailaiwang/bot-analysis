# CS492 Social Bot Analysis Project

Alex Hejmej, Tailai Wang, Isaiah Witzke

## Motivations

Our group is curious about how many comment sections, forums, and online communities are often plagued by content generated by non-humans. Often referred to as Social Bots, AI Bots, or just ‘Bots’, many social media platforms are known for having problems with spam, phishing, and harmful content being shared by these accounts. When Web3 and NFTs were extremely popular, we noticed that Twitter was overrun with obviously fake accounts encouraging users to buy into their pyramid scheme. Around the same time, we noticed how some bots managed to draw extra engagement to extreme posts on Facebook and Reddit concerning vaccine propaganda and conspiracy theories. Our wish is to explore how successful these bots are at creating artificial engagement on social media, and whether or not platforms are able to moderate them at acceptable rates
