The players in Japan had to wait a bit longer for their release, but then again, they did get the 3DS version first. We were glad to be able to release this game in the Americas just in time for Thanksgiving in the United States.\n\n\n\n[Original Miiverse picture](https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/zlCfzSuDrlwyFRUVBo) | [Pic of the Day album](http://imgur.com/a/8KnTr)\n\n[Miiverse post](https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHhpp2Iv5Q) | [Miiverse Japanese post](https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHhppxrFbg)\n\n\n\n**Extra Sakurai post in Miiverse's comments!**  \n>Pic of the day has continued since E3 2013, and I would like to bring this series to a close today.  \nA total of 384 posts and roughly 500 screenshots have been posted, and there's even more screenshots if you count the ones I've posted for different regions.  \n  \nThe origins of pic of the day was sharing one picture a day of the game in development inside the company. It started out just as a small bonus for the staff.  \n  \nHowever, once we started sharing pictures with the public, it was a much tougher process. We had to be more careful to choose appropriate pictures to post while keeping a consistant schedule regardless of how busy we got, all while some people only wanted new information from my posts.  \n  \nIt's nice to finally be able to get one weight off of my shoulders. But, we promised to create Mewtwo as a playable character, so I can't relax too much yet. I hope you'll look forward to Mewtwo joining the battle!",

Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. 7\u00a0And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, \u201cLie with me.\u201d 8\u00a0But he refused and said to his master's wife, \u201cBehold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my charge. 9\u00a0He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?\u201d 10\u00a0And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her. 11\u00a0But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house, 12\u00a0she caught him by his garment, saying, \u201cLie with me.\u201d But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house. 13\u00a0And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house, 14\u00a0she called to the men of her household and said to them, \u201cSee, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice. 15\u00a0And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house.\u201d 16\u00a0Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home, 17\u00a0and she told him the same story, saying, \u201cThe Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me. 18\u00a0But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house.\u201d 19\u00a0As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, \u201cThis is the way your servant treated me,\u201d his anger was kindled. 20\u00a0And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison. \n\n-----\n/r/VerseBot | [How to Use](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerseBot/wiki/index) | [Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerseBot/wiki/changelog) | [Message the Devs](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/VerseBot)",

The protests erupted after President Viktor Yanukovych decided to turn toward Russia for a bailout loan instead of signing a deal with the European Union, but have since morphed into a general plea for more human rights, less corruption and more democracy in this nation of 45 million.\n\n\nThe departure of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov removes one of the officials most disliked by the opposition forces whose protests have turned parts of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, into a barricaded maze.\n\n\nHowever, Azarov's spokesman told the Interfax news agency that deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov will assume temporary leadership of the Cabinet in the meantime. Such a move is unlikely to please the opposition, as Arbuzov is widely viewed as just another staunch ally of Yanukovych.\n\n\nOther key issues remain unresolved in Ukraine's political crisis, including the opposition's repeated demands for Yanukovych to resign and for a new election to be held.\n\n\nAzarov's resignation came just before the opening o......\n\n*****\nContinue reading at: http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ukrainian-premier-submits-resignation \n\n ***** \n \n To learn more about Reddit Bot, visit the wiki: http://www.reddit.com/r/Readdit_Bot/wiki/index \n\n",

The legacy of a burst property bubble has saddled the country with around a million unsold homes and much of the banking sector remains crippled by debt.\n\n\nIn politics, Spain's most populous and richest region \u2014 Catalonia \u2014 is threatening to break away after an independence referendum this year while the ruling conservative party reels from graft allegations and another fraud scandal is sapping respect for the monarchy.\n\n\nNot the best time, then, to launch a bitterly divisive new policy initiative opposed by more than 80 percent of the population, including a significant slice of his own party.\n\n\nUndaunted, Rajoy is pushing ahead with plans to roll back a 2010 law introduced by the previous Socialist administration that made it easier for Spanish women to get an abortion.\n\n\nRajoy says the new law \u2014 which will allow abortions only in cases of rape or where pregnancy presents a grave threat to the women's health \u2014 is the fulfillment of an electoral promise.\n\n\nBut he\u2019s unleashed a storm of opposition at home and abroad with what would be a European first in reversing liberalized abortion rights.\n\n\n\"The whole of Spain has risen up against this erosion of women's freedom and their right to decide something which is entirely their own concern,\" wrote novelist Rosa Regas on the website of a campaign coalition that\u2019s planning mass demonstrations on Saturday.\n\n\nThe abortion debate is particularly polarizing for a society with a deeply conservative Catholic tradition, but also a vigorous feminist movement linked to liberal and socialist political movements that emerged in the 1970s after the end of a four-decade right-wing dictatorship.\n\n\nEighty one percent of voters oppose Rajoy's proposed law, according to a poll released earlier this month by the Invymark......\n\n*****\nContinue reading at: http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/spain/140127/spain-abortion-protest-rajoy \n\n ***** \n \n To learn more about Reddit Bot, visit the wiki: http://www.reddit.com/r/Readdit_Bot/wiki/index \n\n",

When banks are introduced in New Keynesian models, they function not as loan originators but effectively as brokers between savers and borrowers (\n \n  [Eggertsson and Krugman 2012b, pp. 21-22)](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_14)\n .\n\n\nIn response, authors in the Post Keynesian and Endogenous Money traditions express exasperation that New Keynesian authors ignore credit creation and the accounting mechanics of bank lending (\n \n  [Fullwiler 2012;](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_24)\n \n \n  [Roche 2013](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_60)\n ), as laid out in numerous Central Bank publications (\n \n  [Carpenter and Demiralp 2010;](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_9)\n \n \n  [ECB 2012](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_12)\n ; \n \n  [Holmes 1969](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_28)\n ; \n \n  [Keister and McAndrews 2009](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_33)\n ).\n\n\nGiven the key public policy role of economics, and the acknowledged failure of Neoclassical models in general to anticipate the financial crisis (\n \n  [Bezemer 2009;](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_2)\n \n \n  [Blanchard 2009](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_5)\n ; \n \n  [Blanchard, et al. 2010](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_6)\n ; \n \n  [OECD 2007](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_53)\n ), the existence within academic economics of two diametrically opposed perspectives which fail to communicate is a disservice to the public.\n\n\nIn this paper I attempt to conclusively determine whether aggregate private debt and banks matter in macroeconomics by putting the two rival models of lending\u2014Loanable Funds and Endogenous Money\u2014on a common footing. Using the dynamic \n \n  [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)\n  monetary modeling program \n \n  [Minsky](https://sourceforge.net/p/minsky/)\n , I firstly put the New Keynesian model of banking in Eggertsson &amp; Krugman 2012b into a strictly monetary model and I show that, if the structure of lending in this model accurately characterizes actual lending, then the Neoclassical perspective that aggregate debt is unimportant, and that banks can safely be ignored in macroeconomics, is correct. I then modify this model to match the Post Keynesian perspective on the structure of lending, and show that in this structure, changes in the aggregate level of private debt have a direct impact upon aggregate demand, and banks therefore play a crucial role in macroeconomics.\n\n\nThe Neoclassical model of \"Loanable Funds\" and the Post Keynesian concept of \"Endogenous Money\" constitute the polar opposites on the nature and significance of banks, debt and money in macroeconomics. Both models portray the money supply as variable, and hence in one sense endogenous, though by very different mechanisms and to very different degrees (\n \n  [Palley 2013, p. 411)](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_54)\n . In the Loanable Funds tradition, banks function as \"mere intermediaries\" (\n \n  [Graziani 1989, p. 8)](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_26)\n  between savers and borrowers, private debts are \"pure redistributions\" that \"should have no significant macro-economic effects\" (\n \n  [Bernanke 2000, p. 24)](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_1)\n , and banks, debt and money can be and are ignored in canonical macroeconomic models (\n \n  [Smets and Wouters 2007;](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_62)\n \n \n  [Woodford 2009](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_67)\n ). In the Endogenous Money tradition, banks are crucial to macroeconomics because they create money by creating debt (\n \n  [Holmes 1969;](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_28)\n \n \n  [Moore 1979](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_51)\n ), but no consensus has yet emerged on how to represent this phenomenon in Post Keynesian macroeconomic models (\n \n  [Palley 1991;](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_55)\n \n \n  [Palley 2002](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_56)\n ).\n\n\nThere is little communication between the two approaches, with authors in the Loanable Funds tradition frequently deriding those in the Endogenous Money camp (\n \n  [Krugman 2012a;](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_34)\n \n \n  [Krugman 2012b](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_35)\n ; \n \n  [Krugman 2012e](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_38)\n ; \n \n  [Krugman 2012f](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_39)\n ), and dismissing the proposition that banks must be included in macroeconomics (\n \n  [Krugman 2012a;](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/#_ENREF_34)\n \n \n  [Krugman 201......\n\n*****\nContinue reading at: http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/02/02/modeling-financial-instability/ \n\n ***** \n \n To learn more about Reddit Bot, visit the wiki: http://www.reddit.com/r/Readdit_Bot/wiki/index \n\n",

It has all the makings of an \n \n  [inspiring Disney movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Runnings)\n  \u2014 er, an inspiring Disney sequel. Last Sunday, \n \n  [news began trickling](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/19/jamaica-bobsleigh-team-qualifies-winter-olympics)\n  out that a two-man bobsled team from the island nation of Jamaica had qualified for the Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.\n\n\nThe country\u2019s official Twitter account for the 2014 games announced the news that the team had qualified, including an image that appeared to be a reference to \n \n  [Cool Runnings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Runnings)\n , the John Candy-led cult film that loosely chronicled Jamaica\u2019s debut in bobsled for the 1988 Olympic Games in Alberta, Canada.\n\n\nThe world apparently loves a sequel. In a plot twist seemingly right out of Cool Runnings, despite qualifying for the 2014 Olympics, team captain Winston Watts \n \n  [told the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/sports/olympics/jamaican-bobsledders-seek-money-for-sochi-trip.html?_r=2)\n  that the team hadn\u2019t been able to raise the necessary funds to make it to Russia. Watts said that he had essentially been self-funding the team\u2019s efforts thus far, and had even dug into his personal savings to fly the team to the U.S. for the bobsledding qualifiers. Nevertheless, after finding little help from the Jamaican Olympic Association or private investors, the team was forced to turn elsewhere.\n\n\nIn the world of bobsled, and perhaps sports in general, there has never been a more quintessential underdog story. First of all, the Jamaican bobsled team is from, well, Jamaica. Second, the team is competing against teams with <del datetime=\"2014-01-27T11:28:26+00:00\">significant</del> some financial backing (and actually hail from more arctic climes). Not only that, Winston Watts came out of retirement to lead the 2014 bobsled team, and if the team were to compete in Sochi, Watts would be second-oldest bobsled pilot in Olympic history at age 46.\n\n\nLuckily, the citizens of the Internet are sympathetic to an underdog story and were not about to let the team sit this one out due to lack of funding. And that\u2019s when Jamaican bobsledding had its first introduction to the altruistic power of both virtual currency and digital crowdfunding proponents alike. Fittingly, it was a joke currency \u2014 or a virtual currency inspired by a dog meme \u2014 that came to the rescue. Yes, the very peer-to-peer cryptocurrency loved by Lassie, the world\u2019s pooches and geeks alike, and the very currency that began as a joke but has \n \n  [since been hailed as a](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/what-dogecoin-meme-that-became-hot-new-virtual-currency-1429847)\n  potential successor to Bitcoin: The noble, \n \n  [Dogecoin](http://dogecoin.com/)\n .\n\n\nIn a \n \n  [movement that began on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1virfc/lets_send_the_jamaican_bobsled_team_to_the_winter/)\n , the Dogecoin Foundation seized the opportunity to promote its virtual currency on the world stage and help send the Jamaican bobsled team to Sochi. Over a matter of days, the Dogecoin community raised over 27 million Dogecoins, the equivalent of $30,000 for those without a canine cryptocurrency analyst on hand.\n\n\n*That, in and of itself, is something to behold, but the Internet wasn\u2019t done yet. Just as the Dogecoin campaign began to hit full steam, word of the Jamaican bobsled team\u2019s plight got to the founders of Y Combinator-incubated, group-funding platform, \n \n  [Crowdtilt](https://www.crowdtilt.com/)\n .

            "There is no scientific evidence for the existence of \u201cphotographic\u201d or eidetic memory (the ability to remember images with so high a precision as to mimic a camera).[280] Many people have claimed to have a photographic memory, but those people have been shown to have good memories as a result of mnemonic devices rather than a natural capacity for detailed memory encoding.[281] There are rare cases of individuals with exceptional memory, but none of them has a memory that mimics a camera. In recent years, a phenomenon labeled hyperthymesia has been studied, where individuals have superior autobiographical memory\u2014in some cases being able to recall every meal they have ever eaten. One example is actress Marilu Henner.[282]\n\n\nThis response was automatically generated from Wikipedia's [list of common misconceptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions) Questions?

            "In South Korea, it is commonly and incorrectly believed that sleeping in a closed room with an electric fan running can be fatal. According to the Korean government, \"In some cases, a fan turned on too long can cause death from suffocation, hypothermia, or fire from overheating.\" The Korea Consumer Protection Board issued a consumer safety alert recommending that electric fans be set on timers, direction changed and doors left open. Belief in fan death is common even among knowledgeable medical professionals in Korea. According to Yeon Dong-su, dean of Kwandong University's medical school, \"If it is completely sealed, then in the current of an electric fan, the temperature can drop low enough to cause a person to die of hypothermia.\"[185] Whereas an air conditioner transfers heat from the air and cools it, a fan moves air without change of temperature to increase the evaporation of sweat. Leaving a fan running in an unoccupied room will not cool it; in fact, due to energy losses from the motor and viscous dissipation, a fan will slightly heat a room.\n\n\nThis response was automatically generated from Wikipedia's [list of common misconceptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions) Questions?

            "Human blood in veins is not blue. In fact, blood is always red due to hemoglobin. Deoxygenated blood has a deep red color, and oxygenated blood has a light cherry-red color. The misconception probably arises for two reasons. Veins below the skin appear blue. This is due to a variety of reasons only weakly dependent on the color of the blood, including light scattering through the skin, and human color perception.  From the way diagrams use colors to show the difference between veins (usually shown in blue) and arteries (usually shown in red).[194]\n\n\nThis response was automatically generated from Wikipedia's [list of common misconceptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions) Questions?

This means that, for all the math were doing on this feature, whenever we use the range jumped as a variable we first multiply it by 0.1. We will still likely want to revisit the logistical power of these ships in future, but for now we want to bring them into the new system without nerfing them too hard.\n* Black Ops ships will have their range unchanged, but will otherwise get all the described changes. This also keeps the range of their jump portals unchanged. We dont feel that Black Ops range needs adjustment right now.\n\n\n**What are the anticipated consequences?** \n\nIn the short term, we would anticipate a reduction in the degree to which the average non-trivial capital fight escalates, and the number of parties involved. This seems likely to increase the frequency of capitals being deployed in small-scale engagements, in both lowsec and nullsec.\n\nOver the medium term, we see the potential for more substantial changes in the nullsec status quo as the various competing parties work to adjust their internal objectives to the new situation; it seems plausible that the general reduction in travel capabilities will lead to more localism, but we don't want to make any firm predictions in this area. We're confident that these changes improve the overall system of lowsec and nullsec gameplay and take them in better directions, but any set of changes that would allow us to accurately predict their consequences would by their nature be too simple to be interesting for very long.\n\n**What's next?** \n\n* We will be actively participating in the comments thread of this blog and listening elsewhere around the internet.\n* These changes will be appearing on the Singularity test server in the next couple of weeks.\n* We anticipate shipping them in Phoebe, which comes out in November.\n* We are expecting to make follow-up adjustments in Rhea, in December.\n* The medium-term shake-out of these changes will be very impactful on sovereignty-system changes we are anticipating making next year, so we are expecting to revisit all this again as the work on those changes progresses.\n\n\n- Greyscale, on behalf of the Nullsec Working Group (Scarpia, Fozzie, Ytterbium, Rise, Bettik, Delegate Zero, Masterplan and Nullarbor)\n\n**Appendix A Examples** \n\nLittle Bobby Tables is sitting in his Archon in UJY-HE in at the top of Deklein, just after the Oceanus release. He wants to travel to Atioth, at the bottom of Geminate, which is around 50 LY as the space-crow flies. He consults a popular jump planning service, which gives him a route of four jumps and 53 LY. Hes travel fit and has max skills, so his jump range is 14.625 LY and hes expecting to be limited primarily by the session change timer. The journey takes him around two minutes.\n\nA month or so later, hes back in UJY-HE, and Phoebe has just shipped. His Archons jump range is now 5 LY. He consults his jump planner, and finds that his route is now 12 jumps and 54 LY. He hasnt jumped anywhere since the release, so he has no jump fatigue.\n\nHis first jump, of 4.85 LY, takes him to U-TJ7Y. Because he has no fatigue before the jump, he gains a minimum-length jump cooldown timer: 1 minute, plus 4.85 minutes for the distance travelled, for a total of 5.85 minutes, or 5 minutes 51 seconds. He also gains a jump fatigue value of 5.85.\n\nHe waits for just under six minutes. In this time his jump fatigue decays down to 5.27. He then makes his next jump  3.57 LY to LEK-N5. He gets a 5 minute 16 second jump cooldown timer, because his fatigue was 5.27 when he jumped, and his minimum timer would be 4 minutes 34 seconds based on range travelled. He then gets a fatigue increase after the jump. Because he travelled 3.57 LY, his fatigue is multiplied by 4.57, taking it up to 24.06.\n\nHe waits out his timer, which also reduces his fatigue to 23.53. After his cooldown timer expires, he makes his third jump, to RO0-AF, a distance of 4.19 LY. He gains a jump cooldown timer of 23 minutes 32 seconds, and his fatigue is multiplied by 5.19, up to 122.14.\n\nAfter waiting for 23.5 minutes at the convenient local station, his fatigue is down to 119.79. He jumps again, to 2R-CRW  4.9 LY. At this point his cooldown timer is 2 hours 2 minutes 8 seconds, and his fatigue is 706.74. At this point his total distance travelled is 17.51 LY, leaving him with 37.04 LY to go. He looks at his map, and finds a 40-route jump through nullsec to get to the same destination, and figuring two minutes per system, his warp travel time for the whole journey is a bit over half the cooldown for his next jump. He decides to fly there directly rather than trying to jump any further.\n\nThe next week, he finds he needs to take his Ark from HED-GP to 373Z-7, at the bottom of Stain. Its been long enough that his fatigue has entirely decayed, so hes starting fresh again. He plots the route, and sets off.\n\nFirst jump takes him to 5-N2EY, 4.73 LY. Because his jump freighter counts distances as being 10% of their actual distance, he incurs a minimum timer of 1.47 minutes, or 88 seconds. His fatigue similarly becomes 1.47, dropping to 1.32 while he waits out the delay.\n\nHe jumps again when his timer expires, to 4NBN-9, a 4.88 LY jump. His timer after this would be 79 seconds, but because this is a longer jump his minimum is 89 seconds (1.488*60). His fatigue is multiplied by 1.488, taking it to 1.97, and then dropping back to 1.82 as he waits out the timer.\n\nThis continues until he reaches 373Z-7, with a total journey time of around 7.5 minutes, and a jump distance of 22.3 LY.\n\n",
            "New rapid firing anti-sub-capital weapon batteries are specifically designed to fire at sub-capitals. However their damage will be considerably lower than current XL weapon systems (in the 1 to 2k DPS range on a Sieged Dreadnought). They are short range guns, and their tracking will probably be somewhere in the battleship gun range.\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68701/1/high_angle_guns.png)\n\n\n###Capital Armor Plates  Shield Extenders###\n\nThis forms a large part of the HP balance. While traditionally a large part of a sub-capitals EHP came from plates or extenders, there are no capital equivalents. No longer! The choice on what to fit (plates, the most powerful guns, capital neutralizers, etc) will be a very important decision post Citadel expansion.\n\n\n###Capital Warp Disruptors  Scramblers###\n\nThe new capital scramblers and disruptors will offer higher scramble strength with no bonuses to range. Existing officer disruptors and scramblers (which are capital modules) will keep their current roles as longer range capital tackle.\n\n\n##**Carriers, Super-Carriers Fighters** ##\n\nWe are completely re-imagining fighter game-play.\n\n\n###Squadrons###\n\nThe carriers of the Citadel Expansion will launch squadrons, made of up to 12 fighters of the same type.\n\nThese squadrons act as a singular unit. Carrier pilots give orders to an entire squadron. You lock an entire squadron as one unit, except instead of Shields, Armor and Hull, the number of fighters remaining in that squadron are shown.\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68701/1/squadron_targeted.png)\n\nCarriers  Super-Carriers will launch up to 5 separate squadrons at a time. We are intending on introducing 3 classes of fighters, these will replace all existing fighters and fighter-bombers.\n\n| **Light Fighters** | Optimized for anti-Fighter combat and light damage roles|\n|:-|:-|\n| **Support Fighters** | Optimized for Electronic Warfare tasks including (but not limited to) Stasis Webifiers, Warp Disruptors, Neutralizing, Tracking Disrupting, etc.|\n| **Heavy Fighters** | Optimized for launching waves of bombs or torpedoes, able to do tremendous damage to capitals and structures.|\nThe number and types of squadrons a carrier or super-carrier can launch will be limited.\n\nManagement of fighters ready on the launch decks will be an important consideration for carrier pilots. It takes time to swap one squadron of ready fighters out for another, or re-arm your Heavy Fighter Torpedo squadrons.\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68701/1/squadron_hanger.png)\n\n\n###Abilities###\n\nEach fighter squadron can have up to three abilities. These are similar to modules on ships, however there is no fitting for fighter squadrons.\n\nSome of the abilities we're considering to include\n\n* Microwarpdrive\n* Micro Jump Drive\n* Evasive Maneuvers\n* Anti-Fighter Missile Swarm\n* Anti-Capital Torpedos\n* All Electronic Warfare Effects\n* Specialized Beam Weapons\n* Bombs\n\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68701/1/squadron_item.png)\n\n\n###In-space Control###\n\nCarrier pilots will need to be masters of multitasking and positional gameplay. We're introducing a new control paradigm for fighter squadrons. You can order your fighter squadrons to go to a point in space, instead of just objects.\n\n\n\n\n###Camera Control###\n\nYour fighter squadrons will be limited to the same grid as your carrier or super-carrier. No more warping fighters. However, they could be fighting several hundred kilometers away...so Team Psycho Sisters are doing some work on the camera for us. We're enabling you to detach the camera from your ship, or any ship and move it across the grid. They have a whole bunch more Camera magic they are working on, and you'll probably see a devblog from them soon!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###Tactical UI###\n\nAnd lastly, we will be providing you a lot more information about what your squadrons are doing. This is a mock up, and we have a lot of play-testing to do, but it gives you an idea of what we're aiming toward.\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68701/1/squadron_tac.png)\n\n\n###**Super-Weapons** ###\n\nWe have a wide range of super-weapons we're looking at for the Citadel Expansion. We had several requirements for all our Doomsdays -\n\n* All Doomsdays should be fun for both the Titan pilot and the target\n* There should be clear counter-gameplay to all Doomsdays\n* They should be visually impressive\n* The targeting skills of the Titan pilot are much more important. So are the piloting skills of any target.\n\n\n\n####Doomsday Codename: Sickle####\n\nUsing the new UI, a Titan pilot can select two points in space and a powerful energy beam will slash from the Titan to the first point and then move to the second damaging any ships unlucky enough to intersect with the path of the beam.\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68701/1/superweapon_targeting.png)\n\nThe energy requirements of this weapon are so great however, that before firing the Titan neutralizes any ships unlucky enough to be close to it before checking to ensure it has enough capacitor and firing. The Sickle does not differentiate between friend or foe, damaging anyone in its path.\n\nLastly, it takes a while for the Sickle to warm up. During this period it becomes obvious where the beam will slice, giving ships time to get out of the way if their pilots are paying attention.\n\n\n\n\n####Doomsday Codename: Pike####\n\nSimilar to the Sickle, instead of slashing though space this beam is stationary. It neutralizes capacitor, then fires along a path, pulsing every second and doing damage to anyone who stays in its effect radius.\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68701/1/superweapon_pike.png)\n\n\n####Doomsday Codename: Hand of God####\n\nUtilizing Jump Drive technology, the Hand of God will generate an anomaly in space. After a short period of time, anything that isn't a structure or capital class ship will be teleported, together, to a random location in the same system away from the Titan, while the titan stays put. While the effect isn't powerful enough to teleport capitals, it will disrupt their warp and jump drives for a period of time.\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68701/1/superweapon_hog.png)\n\n\n####Doomsday Codename: Cap-Overload####\n\nUtilizing advanced new technology, this weapon destabilizes the capacitors on a ship. After a short period of time (10-15 seconds) any charge on capacitor rapidly discharges...like a smartbomb. The more capacitor the ship has, the more damage it does to itself and nearby ships.\n\n\n###Projected Electronic Warfare###\n\nSuper-carriers won't be left out however! Fighters by their nature can be fighting hundreds of kilometers away from their upercarrier. The super-carriers special weapons compliment this. Building on the Remote ECM Burst, supercarriers will be getting a whole range of remote EWar AOE weapons. The exact details of these weapons aren't finalized, however we're exploring a bunch of option for these, such as:\n\n* Energy Neutralizer Effect\n* Target Painting Debuff\n* Stasis Webifing Debuff\n* Tracking Disrupting Debuff\n* Sensor Damning Debuff\n\n\nWe are looking at expanding this line...think very localized and short term Wormhole effects. However there are some technical challenges to overcome here...so watch this space.\n\nSupercarriers will also have stronger fighter squadron compositions and abilities than Carriers. We feel that the new fighter squadron gameplay and the projected Electronic Warfare Abilities go hand in hand.\n\n\n\nI hope you are all as excited about these changes as we have been imagining and coding them. We will have more devblogs over the coming months, going into specifics about each of these topics. Tell us what you think, including suggestions and concerns. Over the coming weeks we'll be posting how you can apply to be a part of the capital focus group. Keep an eye out for that!\n\n",
            "EVE Online is almost 14 years old now and has seen many battles during its lifetime, and one can say the code base is thoroughly battle tested. However, that doesn't mean sneaky bugs might not be hiding there, but finding a bug in such a fundamental function was surprising, to say the least. I guess we can never assume that any part of our code base is absolutely 100% correct. CCP karkur and others have spent a considerable amount of time tracking this issue down so we had high confidence in the higher level code. This allowed me to go into this investigation on the assumption that Sleep was broken, being stubborn until I found this rare edge case.\n\nWe have reason to believe that a few other bugs are symptoms of the same underlying issue - the overview not updating, for example, or the shield, armor and structure bars not updating. These bugs have always been nearly impossible to reproduce but nevertheless are reported occasionally, especially after mass tests or heavy fights on Tranquility.\n\n",
            "s no way to win. The best you can do is to not lose. Plus just to reduce the chances of losing, you have to spend hours doing exceedingly tedious tasks. This is the situation sov holders find themselves in under Kafkasov. Theres no winnable bet because theres no reward that is worth the effort.\n\nThere are two potential solutions to this. One is to increase the value of sov holding to the point where it makes the game worthwhile. The anomaly buffs were a modest attempt at this. I think, however, that to make this game palatable, youd have to make sov so ludicrously overvalued as to disrupt the EVE economy. The other solution is to change the game. I can think of several ways to do this:\n\n1. \u00a0Entosis links, when active, should no longer make the ship immune to remote reps, but should instead reduce or eliminate movement. Some have suggested simply disabling prop mods. If a ship needs to be defended to finish the job, instead of merely running away at top speed when enemies approach, fights will be more frequent. The attacker will have skin in the game and they will have to actually have grid superiority to hack something. It will give the defender the chance they need to avoid pointless timers the attacker wont be back for anyway.\n\n2. \u00a0Reduce the massive disparity between the effort required by attackers and the effort required by defenders. For every 20 minute hack by an attacker, there is a guaranteed couple of hours required by a defender to fix the timer, even if NOBODY shows up to contest. Thats a massive disparity that leads to pointless griefing that is boring for everyone, and no fights. Beyond a certain sov index, it should be very very easy for a defender to fix a timer. below that breaking point the sov should be increasingly hard to defend. Right now, even at maximum ADM level, the amount of time it takes to defend is much more than it took to hack in the first place. That should be reversed. Somewhere over 3\u00a0ADM there should be a break even point, and by 6, the amount of time should be substantially in favor of the defender. Remember, they spent literally hours getting that ADM up, it should be good for something besides a slightly longer timer. Conversely, you could even increase the disparity at the lowest ADM levels, so that it requires truly stupid amounts of time to defend a very low index system. This would make truly unused space tend to revert to empty easily. Coordinated attacks on firmly held sov should require getting that index down first.\n\nBut Thoric, you say, this sounds like you are favoring the Imperium? Well never be able to take your sov! Frankly, no one is taking it now. The people who are getting clobbered are the poor guys who thought they could take 2-3 systems in a quiet backwater, and make themselves a little space empire. They are spending so much time defending it against every troll in the galaxy they barely have time to do anything with it. Most of them are giving up on the idea. Others are watching and deciding its not worth the effort. Youll never see smaller entities out there unless they can make their sov defensible against trolling and other small entities.\n\n3. \u00a0Remove the ability to hack station services outside the vulnerability window. This is just annoying, and adds nothing to gameplay.\n\n4. \u00a0Change the way that sovereignty windows are done altogether. I will speak more on this at a later date. I am still formulating my thoughts on this subject. Ideally however, it would give those aforementioned smaller entities the free time they need to work index, maybe leave their systems for a bit of a roam to seek fights, or just take a day off now and then so EVE doesnt become a job.\n\nIf you do these things, sov once again becomes a winnable bet. Some of the future promised group pve experiences and other enhancements might even make it truly desirable. One can hope. I\u00a0might even stop calling it Kafkasov.\n\n",
            ") one of these physical hosts needs hardware maintenance or needs to be taken offline for some reason. At this point, in a typical two-node physical cluster we would be forced to run on only one cluster node and have fingers crossed that our now-single-point-of-failure does not fail. Lots of soulful Amarrian prayers would be required.\n\nWith our virtual direction, we could simply vMotion the passive cluster node from its dedicated ESXi host to another ESXi host (the one hosting the 2nd clusters passive node)...and Bobs yer uncle! Sure that one host with two passive nodes will now be over-allocated, but we would have to lose two more hosts before that becomes an issue!\n\nThis means that not only are we redundant on the SQL Instance level by using Windows Failover Clustering, but we'll now be able to survive more than one hardware failure as well! We have a lot of testing to do with this but for the most part this is all proven tech, so really, what could possibly go wrong?!\n\nYours always!\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68643/1/7.png)\n\nCCP DeNormalized, CCP Hunter, CCP Stephanie, and CCP Jolin\n\n\n\n\n##Back To The Cluster!##\n\nSpecs of Current TQTech II vsTQTech III\n\n| **Node role** | **TQTech II** | **TQTech III** |\n|:-|:-|:-|\n| Standard SOL Nodes| 51 x IBM HS21XM - IntelX5260CPU @ 3.33GHz with 32GB RAM (1333MHz)| 30x IBM x240- Intel E5-2637-V3 CPU @3.5GHz CPU with 64GB RAM(2133MHz)|\n| Enhanced SOL Nodes| 9 x IBM HS23 - Intel Xeon CPU @ 3.30GHz with 64GB RAM(1333MHz)| 6x IBM x240  Intel E5-2667 v3 CPU @ 3.2GHz with 128GB RAM (2133MHz)|\n| Everest Node| NDA| N/A|\n| DUST514 Proxy Node| 4 x IBM HS22 - Intel X5687 @ 3.60GHz with 24GB RAM(1333MHz)| Will run on Eve proxies|\n| EVE Proxy Node| 5 x IBM HS23 - Intel E5-2643 0 @ 3.30GHz with 64GB RAM (1600MHz)| 6x IBM x240 - Intel E5-2667 v3 CPU @ 3.2GHz with 128GB (2133MHz)|\n| ESXi / Virtual hosts| 4x IBM HS 22 - Intel E5620 @ 2.4GHz 146GB RAM (1333MHz)3x IBM HS 22 - Intel E2640 @ 2.6GHz 146GB RAM (1333MHz)2x IBM HS 22 - Intel X5690 @ 3.4GHz 96GB RAM (1333MHz)| 6x IBM Flex x240 Intel E5 2640 v3 @ 2.6GHz 386GB RAM (2133MHz)|\n| Database Server| 2x IBM X3960 X5  Intel X7560 @ 2.26 GHz with 512GB RAM (1066 MHz)| 2x X880 X6 FlexNode  Intel E7-8893 V3 @ 3.2 GHz with 768GB RAM (1866 MHz)|\n\n\n\n##**Network Upgrade** ##\n\nAt this stage, we have talked a lot about fast servers with a ton of fast storage. But something needs to connect that all together and then to the place with all the funny cat pictures (the Internet). Otherwise EVE Online is not so much... online.\n\nOver to our Network Team for more info.\n\nAt the network edge, our trusty Cisco 7606 routers have served us well since 2009. We peer with over 20 providers and get full BGP tables from five of them, making for a total ofover two millionpath attribute entries that get compiled into the half-million global BGP best-path route table on each edge router. These venerable beasts of the routing world have been handling all of that without breaking a sweat.\n\nStill, technology has moved forward in leaps and bounds during the last six years, and it's time to retire those old routers and replace them with a new generation. In order to best serve you, the glorious pilots of New Eden, we are once again investing in the best and the greatest. TQ deserves nothing less!\n\nThe new boxes are a whole order of magnitude more powerful, offering throughput of 120Gbps and more than double the memory, allowing us to peer with more providers. The extra RAM also allows them to keep pre-calculated backup BGP routes in memory for every active route, so that a failed path may be switched to a secondary path in a matter of few milliseconds. That means that if a directly-connected provider fails, most players routed via that provider get switched to a new provider without being disconnected. The new routers will allow us to provide better connectivity while opening a whole new universe of possibilities with their new features, doing so with expanded memory and processing power.\n\nOther fundamental part of TQs current edge network are Cisco ACE 30 load-balancers. As quirky as those boxes have been to configure, they have a special place on our technology-loving hearts here at CCP as they have allowed us to rapidly deploy major changes to TQ and have proved to be rock-solid.\n\nHowever, a couple of years ago Cisco pulled out of the load-balancing market and left the ACE as a moribund platform dying a slow death. Since then we have been testing different platforms and are excited to have found a great replacement that brings improved performance as well as a whole new bag of tricks.\n\nIn performance terms alone, with New TQ we are increasing throughput from 16Gbps to 30Gbps and maximum concurrent connections from 4 million to 24 million. The new load-balancers have gotten all of us, not only in OPS but also in EVE Development, rubbing our hands with glee like a capsuleer who just got their hands on their first Titan.\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68643/1/8.png)\n\n\n\n\n##**Player Connectivity** ##\n\nWe are not just replacing old hardware with new, but also looking at what more can be done to improve the player experiences with regards to connectivity. As part of that effort, we will be deploying a new Intelligent Routing Platform to optimize BGP routing. This system will automatically test both latency and packet loss to every single player upon connection to TQ, running tests simultaneously over each of our connected providers and peers back to the player's ISP (Internet Service Provider).*It will also non-disruptively switch each connection to the best available path*.\n\nActive connections get tested every few hours. This system has proven to be able to seamlessly bypass many problems and blackouts that regularly afflict the rough seas of the Internet. The excellent reporting will also allow us to tailor our selection of providers to the ones that perform best for EVE players.\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68643/1/9.png)\n\n[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68643/1/10.png)\n\nOn our tests, as you can see on the charts above, the Intelligent Routing Platform was able to improve on connections to over 7,000 ISP networks worldwide, eliminating packet loss in 91% of connections to TQ where packet loss existed, and bypassing blackouts on internet routes in 59% of cases. Latency is also much improved, with reduction of at least 20% in more than half of the high-latency connections. Those are the types of metrics we love to see!\n\nFinally, we will continue to expand our peering with LINX, the London Network Exchange, which allows us to peer directly with a large number of ISPs. That way, players connecting via those ISPs can reach TQ directly, without crossing any additional networks on the public internet, cutting down on the number of hops and offering a much more stable connection.\n\nWe would love to tell you all about the specs of these new boxes in mind-numbing details (we can talk about that endlessly, believe me!), but our security specialists tell us that we must keep most of that secret. But, but, but, if you come to the OPS discussion roundtable at the next EVE Fanfest, we promise to share with you glimpses of this wonderfully new and improved world of Internet spaceship networking.\n\n- CCP Lucca and CCP Skylark\n\n\n\n\n##A Modern Home##\n\nTQ started in a hosting center called Cable and Wireless in London, then moved across the street into Telecity in February 2006. Now, about a decade later, it is time to move to a new data center (opened in 2014) with the latest design in the data center industry.\n\nFor couple of months we will have both sites operational in parallel. Then, when we are ready, we will swap over with the goal to have as short of a downtime as possible.\n\nWe aim to have TQ Tech III up and running in very early 2016.\n\nThen we will relocate what is soon-to-be-known-as Old TQ"

It also occurs, though less frequently, in adults. PCS manifests itself as a very intense, sharp pain, typically at the left side of the chest, generally in the cartilage between the bones of the sternum and rib cage, which is worse when taking breaths. Patients often think that they are having a heart attack which causes them to panic. This pain typically lasts from 2 or 3 seconds to a few minutes, though, in some cases, they can persist for up to 30 minutes. The frequency of episodes varies from patient to patient; sometimes occurring daily with multiple episodes each day, or on a less frequent basis with weeks, months, or even years between episodes. On rare occasions, breathing in or out suddenly will cause a small popping or cracking sensation in the chest, which results in the pain going away.

            "*Here is the text of the [accepted answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/671132#671132) to the [question](http://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming) linked above, by user [Emil H](http://stackoverflow.com/users/73772):* \n\n---\n>_REST_ is the underlying architectural principle of the web. The amazing thing\n>    about the web is the fact that clients (browsers) and servers can interact in\n>    complex ways without the client knowing anything beforehand about the server\n>    and the resources it hosts. The key constraint is that the server and client\n>    must both agree on the _media_ used, which in the case of the web is _HTML_.\n>    \n>    An API that adheres to the principles of _REST_ does not require the client to\n>    know anything about the structure of the API. Rather, the server needs to\n>    provide whatever information the client needs to interact with the service. An\n>    _HTML form_ is an example of this: The server specifies the location of the\n>    resource, and the required fields. **The browser doesn't know in advance where\n>    to submit the information, and it doesn't know in advance what information to\n>    submit. Both forms of information are entirely supplied by the server.** (This\n>    principle is called _HATEOAS_.)\n>    \n>    **So, how does this apply to _HTTP_, and how can it be implemented in practice?** HTTP is oriented around verbs and resources. The two verbs in mainstream usage are GET and POST, which I think everyone will recognize. However, the HTTP standard defines several others such as PUT and DELETE. These verbs are then applied to resources, according to the instructions provided by the server.\n>    \n>    For example, Let's imagine that we have a user database that is managed by a\n>    web service. Our service uses a custom hypermedia based on JSON, for which we\n>    assign the mimetype _application/json+userdb_ (There might also be an\n>    _application/xml+userdb_ and _application/whatever+userdb_ \\- many media types\n>    may be supported). The client and the server has both been programmed to\n>    understand this format, but they don't know anything about each other. As [Roy\n>    Fielding](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-\n>    driven) points out:\n>    \n>    > A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the\n>    media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state,\n>    or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for\n>    existing standard media types.\n>    \n>    A request for the base resource / might return something like this:\n>    \n>    **Request**\n>        \n>        \n>        GET /\n>        Accept: application/json+userdb\n>        \n>    \n>    **Response**\n>        \n>        \n>        200 OK\n>        Content-Type: application/json+userdb\n>        \n>        {\n>            \"version\": \"1.0\",\n>            \"links\": [\n>                {\n>                    \"href\": \"/user\",\n>                    \"rel\": \"list\",\n>                    \"method\": \"GET\"\n>                },\n>                {\n>                    \"href\": \"/user\",\n>                    \"rel\": \"create\",\n>                    \"method\": \"POST\"\n>                }\n>            ]\n>        }\n>        \n>    \n>    We know from the description of our media that we can find information about\n>    related resources from sections called \"links\".

A few files would not be where I remembered them, or they would be missing entirely. Little problems that could have been my memory playing tricks on me. Then the little problems became a big problem when a collection of work files disappeared. Initially I suspected the hard drive, there were some bad sectors reported on the disk with the problems. Then it happened on other drives. 3 physical disks were affected by this, so it was not likely to be a hardware fault.\n>\n>I dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 8. Windows gets used infrequently for gaming, day to day use is in Ubuntu. My files are on NTFS formatted disks, separate to the OS partitions. I finally spotted the correlation between OS and missing files after the virtual hard drive for a VM I had\u00a0 set up vanished - directly following a reboot into Windows. The little missing files suddenly fell into a pattern of my Windows activity.\n>\n>Eventually, I was able to track down the problem. Windows 8 has a new feature called Fast Startup. It merges power off with hibernate, to reduce cold boot times, and is enabled by default. Fast Startup saves the state of all mounted drives on shutdown, including which files are present. After rebooting into Linux, I alter some files, and create others. I then reboot into Windows. The drives are compared to their saved state, and the differences are \"repaired\" back to how Windows remembers the drive being. Result: all the files added in Linux are removed.\n>\n>Chkdsk was able to recover most of the files. Fortunately, Fast Startup can be disabled in Windows' power options (_Control Panel>Hardware and Sound>Power Options>Choose what the power buttons do_). All seems to be working now so hopefully this will not happen again, and I can stop worrying that I'm losing my mind.\n>\n>Moral of the story: **If you dual boot with Windows 8 and have shared partitions, you may need to disable Fast Startup**\ufeff"

The \"space\" themed sets from the 80s and 90s like  Blacktron, M-Tron, Space Police etc. are awesome sets and I can't, for the life of me, figure out why similar sets aren't being produced today.  Do they really not sell?  All you can find these days are movie themed sets, ninja dragon/motorcycle sets or bug sets.  What gives?",

            "Yeah, the whole jist of the EU after the fall of the empire was Leia having to go from fiefdom to fiefdom and either fighting the local Imperials or convincing them to switch sides.  Which is how Thrawn came into the picture and that was a fantastic series of stories.",
            "But that doesn't make sense to me.  Vader had been the face of the empire since its inception.  Surely the high-ranking officers had heard of his exploits and knew to take him seriously?  I mean, how many people does a guy have to force-choke before word gets around?\n\nHan not knowing about it makes sense, a commenter below points out there were ~10k Jedi at the time of Order 66, so in a galaxy of trillions, it's not that far fetched to believe Han had never encountered one.",
            "**No fourth wall**, but relevant, story time!  I was one of the best TIE Interceptor pilots in the X-wing vs. TIE Fighter (XvT) game for a period of time (maybe a year?) If you're curious, look up TIE Fighter Alliance [TFA] and find the records for RG (Royal Guard) or TFA Nightbird -- that's me!\n\nAnyway, I was looking for a few practice matches one day and happened across a guy hosting fights while flying a Y-wing.  (I cannot recall what the pilot's name was, unfortunately.)  Feeling pretty cocky and keeping the \"Maneuverability is king.\" mantra in my head, I challenged him to a 1-on-1 match.\n\nHow matches worked in XvT was you flew one 5m match with one person hosting then 5m with the other person hosting.  The final score was the tallied results.  The reason for this is that there was a huge bias in the XvT network code towards the hoster (meaning the host had a HUGE advantage).  Anyway, we get into the fight on his host and I use the typical corkscrew/figure-eight approach.  I get obliterated by a literal wall of laser and ion fire.  Ok, next spawn.  Vector off to the side and redirect to engines to use my speed to get behind him.  Success!  Throttle to 1/3rd to maximize turning ratios...BLAM!  He put the brakes on, full rear-shields and I flew right into it and exploded.  Next spawn, same vectored approach.  Behind him with 1/3rd throttle and mashing the controls to match speed.  He hit the brakes, I stopped, he flipped 180 (so he's facing me upside down) and we kill each other.  Progress!\n\nThis went on for the remainder of his host and mine--he pulled out some wicked tricks and totally changed my perspective on the Y-wing as a viable craft.  We ended up flying against each other maybe half a dozen times.  I think I ended up winning maybe one or two of the matches towards the end.  So, hats off to you mystery Y-wing pilot!\n\n*edit grammar"

            "Yea, I've been wondering about that myself.\n\nAs a counterpoint, take a look at the [review of Pokemon X/Y we did here in /r/3DS](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1ztev3/rate_and_review_pokemon_xy_will_calculate_an/). The final average rating was 6.67/10 which I believe is a couple points lower than the critics.\n\nOverall I agree with the theory though. This is a subreddit for 3DS fans and therefore you have a lot of people here that only play 3DS as opposed to the average video game critic which plays every console available.\n\nThat being said, I'll reserve judgement until multiple reviews happen where a more significant number of user reviews are submitted and therefore gives us a more accurate picture of this subreddit's bias.",
            "It's a small sample size. I feel like there was just a lot of people that didn't like Pokemon leaving reviews while the Yoshi reviewers were just like \"this game was fun despite all of the negative reviews out there\".\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure these average review scores will be indicators that you can take at face value. Each review thread has it's own unique set of contributors and therefore are hard to compare with each other.",
            "Yea, couple factors went into that high score:\n\n* I crossposted the review thread to r/BravelyDefault which probably resulted in a lot of hardcore fans submitting reviews.\n\n* It was only a week or two after the game came out. Since then I've heard a lot of people say that the end of the game isn't very good (like /u/currybot mentioned in his reply).\n\nI think it is a good candidate to do a fresh review from scratch.",
            "That was actually the first one we did - http://www.redditreviewbot.com/video-games/bravely-default-for-3ds\n\nI kind of want to do it again though because we were rating 1 to 5 at that time. Idk if it would get upvoted again though."

Natural history books from the 18th century recount an often-repeated, but unproven anecdote of \"counting crows\" \u2014 specifically a crow whose ability to count to five (or four in some versions) is established through a logic trap set by a farmer. Crows and ravens often score very highly on intelligence tests. Certain species top the avian IQ scale. Wild hooded crows in Israel have learned to use bread crumbs for bait-fishing. Crows will engage in a kind of mid-air jousting, or air-\"chicken\" to establish pecking order. Crows have been found to engage in feats such as sports, tool use, the ability to hide and store food across seasons, episodic-like memory, and the ability to use individual experience in predicting the behavior of environmental conspecifics.\n\n>One species, the New Caledonian Crow, has also been intensively studied recently because of its ability to manufacture and use its own tools in the day-to-day search for food. These tools include \"knives\" cut from stiff leaves and stiff stalks of grass. Another skill involves dropping tough nuts into a trafficked street and waiting for a car to crush them open. On October 5, 2007, researchers from the University of Oxford, England, presented data acquired by mounting tiny video cameras on the tails of New Caledonian Crows. It turned out that they use a larger variety of tools than previously known, plucking, smoothing, and bending twigs and grass stems to procure a variety of foodstuffs. Crows in Queensland, Australia, have learned how to eat the toxic cane toad by flipping the cane toad on its back and violently stabbing the throat where the skin is thinner, allowing the crow to access the non-toxic innards; their long beaks ensure that all of the innards can be removed.\n\n>Crows have demonstrated the ability to distinguish individual humans by recognizing facial features.\n\n>Evidence also suggests that they are one of the few non-human animals capable of displacement (linguistics) (communicating about things that are happening in a different spatial or temporal location to the here and now).\n\n---\n\n[^(about)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^(/u/sinndogg can reply with 'delete'.

            "me too, i asked ChatGPT to summarize it...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n`The article discusses the challenges of quantifying ultrastructural features of pleomorphic organelles in three dimensions using cellular cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and proposes a semiautomated workflow to segment organellar membranes and reconstruct their underlying surface geometry in cryo-ET. The authors also developed an open-source suite of ultrastructural quantifications, integrated into a single pipeline called the surface morphometrics pipeline, which enables rapid modeling of complex membrane structures and allows detailed mapping of inter- and intramembrane spacing, curvedness, and orientation. The authors demonstrate the advantages of this approach by combining cryo-ET with cryo-fluorescence microscopy to correlate bulk mitochondrial network morphology with membrane ultrastructure of individual mitochondria in the presence and absence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Using their pipeline, the authors demonstrate ER stress promotes adaptive remodeling of ultrastructural features of mitochondria and suggest that changes in membrane ultrastructure correlate to mitochondrial network morphologies. Overall, the pipeline offers opportunities for quantifying changes in membrane ultrastructure on a single-cell level using cryo-ET, opening new opportunities to define changes in ultrastructural features induced by diverse types of cellular perturbations`\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso i said \"Explain like i'm Five\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Scientists want to see how tiny parts inside cells look like in 3D to understand how cells work. They use a fancy machine called cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to take pictures of these tiny parts. But it's hard to understand what the pictures mean. So, the scientists came up with a way to make the pictures easier to understand. They made a computer program that helps them to see the parts better and to compare them with other cells. They used this program to study mitochondria, tiny parts that make energy for cells. They found that when cells are stressed, mitochondria change their shape and structure to adapt to the stress. They hope that this program will help them learn more about how cells work and how they respond to different conditions.",

            "*I am a bot. Here's a transcript of the linked blue post for those of you at work:*\n\n### Update 7.1 Arena Changes ###\n\nZeriyah / Community Manager \n\n*****\n\nIn our next update, we will be making a few changes to the Arena that should make it more interesting for our players and offer a much different experience with each set release. \n\n**\u2022Arena will change from Wild format to Standard**\n+ As more cards are added to the Arena pool, having each game feel meaningfully different actually becomes harder to accomplish. Many of the cool synergies between cards, such as Jade Golems or Mechs, live within each individual set release. Attempting to create decks that utilize these meaningful synergies in a wide and diluted card pool will become more and more difficult as the Wild card pool grows larger. Arena runs then becomes less about card synergies and smart deck choices and more about being fortunate enough to be presented with the best card from each set. This change should put the focus back on the player for good, synergistic Arena choices and make Arena decks feel more cohesive. \n\n+ We\u2019ll be monitoring using the Standard format in Arena carefully, and we may add additional changes or formats in the future if it doesn\u2019t meet our goals of having Arena feel interesting and different with each set release. \n\n**\u2022Changes to Card Rarity Distribution**\n+ We\u2019re making a change to the frequency in which Common and Basic cards show up in the Arena. Common cards were about 78% of all Arena cards, and we felt that number was too high considering that many of the cards that focus around individual class identity and power level rely on the common cards of any given class. After this change, the number of Common and Basic cards that show up overall should be lower, giving more room for fun Rare, Epic, and Legendary cards to show up in an Arena run. In addition, the cards Abyssal Enforcer and Flamestrike will show up approximately 50% less in Arena.\n\n**\u2022More Spells in a Run**\n+ Spells have the power to swing a board state, generally more than minions do. Obviously, there are some exceptions to this. When the distribution of spells to minions is too low, the game usually ends up in the favor of the player that gets out their minions faster and more efficiently than the other player, because there aren\u2019t enough cards that punish overextending. Bringing the distributions of spells and minions closer together allows for more room to have an Arena game that is more strategic and facilitates more plays and counter-plays to occur.\n\n**\u2022Neutral Classic Cards Show Up Less**\n+ A lot of neutral Classic cards tend to be minions without any text that lack interesting effects. While they are great for introducing newer players to Hearthstone and providing baselines for power level comparisons, they don\u2019t make for compelling Arena run choices. This helps make more room for spells, class cards, and expansion cards to show up at a higher rate. \n\nThese changes will occur in an upcoming update near the end of February. We\u2019ll see you in the Tavern!",

It manages the list of blog spammers, and sends them a polite message before it spams their blog post.\n\n2. It kills links to known meme sites, after politely telling the submitter that we don't do that here.\n\n3. It reports every image submission, because a lot of them break the rules. In the past we've often missed them until it's too late, but now they all get reported, so it's likely a mod will see the report and remove them.\n\n4. It manages the list of related subreddits in the side-bar. There was a lot of complaint in the mod group that the side-bar was getting too big, so it automatically checks traffic in the related subs every few hours and displays the ones that are getting the most traffic.\n\n5. It is rotating the subreddit banner every so often now, because I wanted to see if that worked, but eventually it will manage the holiday schedule for banners and other announcements.\n\n6. It could conceivably reply to people who quote Bible verses with links to a Bible verse site, but I've been told that people will hate that, so it doesn't.\n\nIt is not putting the human mods out of business, but it is making managing the mod queue a little easier.",

            ">I'll try to be be brief.  I'm still fuming.  My husband (M29) comes from a big family, four brothers, two sisters, raised by a single mother for the most part.\n>\n>The youngest of his siblings is J (M19) in the six years I've known J he's always seemed awkward and a little too quiet and socially inept.  I have always had a special fondness towards J because he's such a sweet person and I was a little awkward growing up myself.\n>\n>J has been struggling with some classes and I've been helping him.  My husband took me on a special dinner night to thank me for this and it was there that he revealed why J sometimes struggles.  Apparently, their dad who is now dead left their mom over accusations that J was a product of infidelity.  He was not.  But their dad was super paranoid about infidelity and treated his wife like property.  The father started abusing J when J was as young as two, beating him.  He left shortly thereafter and passed away a few years after that.  \n>\n>The abuse didn't stop there.  My MIL picked up where the father left off.  The beatings and abuse is too graphic and unspeakable for me to detail it here.  It's disgusting and inhumane.  My husband said that all the siblings took part including himself.  When I could no longer take listening to the details and the extent to which my husband participated I asked him why and how he could do those things.  He went into full on defense mode when he saw how furious I was and said they were told he was not their brother.  Like that's a valid excuse?  He said the family buried it and doesn't talk about it.  That J started defending himself at about 13 and the abuse stopped then.  I asked him if anybody had apologized to J.  He said he doesn't need an apology, that he just needs to forget and in time he will.  \n>\n>since that night three weeks ago I have been unable to be affectionate in any way towards my husband.  It's like I went from totally in love, the totally repulsed by him. He's suddenly somebody I don't even know.  I honestly don't know why J has chosen to stay around all these animals and I'm disgusted with myself for marrying one.  Last weekend we had a back yard cook out as we often do.  Most of his siblings were here.  J knocked over a pitcher of Iced tea.  He's a little shaky and a little clumsy but it was an accident obviously.\n>\n>My MIL went off and started berating him and called him an idiot and a few other names.  She started to berate him about his hands and how they shake so much and told him to get control of it and stop shaking.  I gave my husband a look, like, \"hey jump in here.\"  He didn't do anything.  I lost it.  I went completely crazy on her and told her that maybe if she hadn't beat him and other things...\n>\n>At this point my husband jumped in and told me to take it easy on his mom.  I told her to leave and she told everybody to leave with her.  J only stayed because I practically begged him to stay but she told him to leave too.  I tried to talk to my husband about what happened and why I went off.  He told me to mind my own business about his family business.  I told him to leave at this point.  He reluctantly left and has been calling, and texting me non stop to forgive him.\n>\n>\n>**EDIT**  Finally heard back from a friend I had emailed.  She's a counselor.  She told me I atcually victimized J by bringing up the abuse that Friday night.  She says I should have simply stood up for him for what happened that night.  She says I should apologize to him for that and I will tonight.  She also said it's probably going to be the first and only apology J ever gets that's even remotely related to all the abuse he suffered \"so be ready for anything\".  I'm picking him up at his friend's house tonight.  His mom kicked him out over what happened.  Everything is happening so fast now.  My parents have stepped up big time and offered to move him in.  My dad is going to teach him how to drive and help him get his DL.  He's going to give him his old car that nobody drives.  Now we just have to convince him to accept our help.  Haven't read all your comments but I will.  Just things are happening fast I need to keep up.  I know my kids will be fine.  Right now I'm in full \"get J help mode.\"  I have not read all your comments but I will.  Thank you all.\n>\n>Oh I almost forgot.  I spoke to my husband on the phone finally.  He thinks he's going to talk his way back.  I asked him why his mom kicked out J.  He said he had no idea what I was talking about, he didn't know.  J told me that my husband has been staying at his mom's and he was there when J was kicked out.  I will file divorce, no chance I'm taking him back.\n>\n>**EDIT**  Some of you have asked about the details of he abuse.  I left them out to spare you.  Something inside you breaks when you hear the details of what they did to J.  I wanted people to read this and not have to visualize it.  Horrible and tragic are not big enough words.  \n>\n>**Edit** Sorry I can't respond to every comment and thanks for some kind words.  But just too add some clarity to some questions I keep seeing.  No, he has no remorse, nor does he think an apology is needed.  He also feels no therapy is needed for anybody, just time to heal.   But at the same time he acknowledges that J's shaking and struggle are a result of he abuse.   I don't get this contradiction but I will get therapy for myself as well and try to get more answers.  Also Yes, my dad is pretty awesome, I knew he would spring into action if I just talked to him.  My mom is great too.  I knew dad would get her to sign on as well.  They like J, and they had reservations about me marrying my husband but that was for other seemingly petty reasons at the time.  I swear on my life that I did not know my husband and his family had this secret.  \n>\n>I only knew that they all seemed normal but J was clearly damaged.  He is very sweet natured but you can tell he has endured some things.  I always wanted to get close to him and try to understand him but I never would have guessed.\n>\n>\n>   \n>**tl;dr** **My husband participated in disgusting inhumane abuse of his youngest brother.  I want a divorce, I think I want him in jail**",

            ">I'm posting this on a throwaway because I don't want reddit to know it's me just yet. For a while now I've been a moderator here at /r/Games because I liked the community and am heavily involved in the gaming scene. I love this place, but something has completely destroyed my faith in it. We delete comments all the time to the effect of \"X is paid off by Y\" or \"you're a shill for Z\". They're fake and dumb and get deleted.\n>\n>But over the course of the last month or so, I've found that that's not true. The truth is, someone is being paid off. Someone sent us a modmail last month asking why a moderator had deleted his thread with some negative news regarding the PS4, so since it was late I decided to investigate a bit. The moderator, /u/IceBreak, had deleted the thread. I thought nothing of it until identical threads with the news got deleted by the same moderator each time.\n>\n>I knew that IceBreak was a moderator of /r/PS4 and /r/XboxOne, and when he was added to the team I definitely had my concerns. I decided to look into some of his other deletions and found something jarring. Over the past 3 months he's been solely deleting negative PS4 news and positive Xbox news. I decided to take it up with him personally before doing anything else, but he kept deflecting and I got nowhere.\n>\n>Nothing happened until a few days later, [when this wound up in modmail](http://puu.sh/7RAcf.png). Granted, this screenshot's a little vague so let me give some background. The user had posted a news story giving positive light to the Xbox One a bit earlier, which had been deleted a few minutes after by IceBreak. This language isn't acceptable, so I confronted him again, this time in IRC. Here's a log of that conversation. [Pt1](http://puu.sh/7RBAX.png) - [Pt2](http://puu.sh/7RBCX.png)\n>\n>After this conversation I considered talking to Deimorz, our top mod and reddit admin, but decided against it. I felt like him knowing someone knew would dissuade him from doing it further. Unfortunately I was wrong. Two days ago (as of this posting) I started checking up on his moderation log again to find that he'd still been removing negative PS4 news and discussions. This was the last straw.\n>\n>I was the only one to see this in however long he'd been a mod, and nothing has been done about it. /r/Games has completely changed from what I remember, so I see no reason to fix it internally. Instead I'm leaving it up to the users to decide. Sony had approached us months ago but I didn't think it was a serious thing, now I'm more sure than ever that corporations are controlling mods and subreddits. I want no part of it. As for why I haven't officially resigned, I'd rather find myself another subreddit to call a home first, maybe /r/GamerNews or /r/TrueGaming. Once I've done that I'm gone.\n>\n>This thread will probably be deleted but I'll do everything I can to keep it up, even if it means clicking approve every 5 seconds (or making a bot to do so for me). This must be known and I'm willing to do everything in my power to make sure everyone sees this. Thank you for reading.\n>\n>tl;dr /u/IceBreak is being paid off and should be banned from reddit"

I have no doubt Pepsi chemists are more than capable of creating a drink that tastes identical to coke.

Hands down. And let me tell you why: He has so much depth and complexity that is gradually revealed over time and his emotional demeanor is the most believable of the series. At first, we are made to think he is the villain. Impatient, Intimidating, a bully to his students. The first real shock about his character is that he had no interest in obtaining the Philosopher's Stone *or* killing Harry. The guy was actively protecting him. And this is where my love for him sets its roots. \n\nThroughout the series, he's pretty much same old Snape. Loathing Harry and being biased towards Slytherins until we get to The Prisoner of Azkaban. We get hints and then confirmation that Snape;s hatred of Harry begins with Harry's father - but we are only told by Dumbledore that its because Harry's father saved Snapes life. *Later* though we found out that Jame's was trying to get himself out of trouble more than saving Snape. Further along we see the memory where Snape is actively bullied by Harry's father and godfather alike. So we naturally assume that Snape's bitterness towards Harry *and* Sirius stems from being bullied at school. For Sirius, this is true. But for Harry, false. \n\nIt boils down to what Harry is to Snape. Harry is a visual and sometimes behavioral mirror image of his father. Well known, talented at magic and Quidditch, and possesses a knack for getting into trouble. But emotionally, Harry is all that's left of his mother. Lily Evans, the only woman Snape ever loved. \n\nIt's heartbreaking, really, how long Snape has clung to his hopes of happily ever after with Lily. Since he was a small child he was obsessed with her (and his obsession fuels the theory that he has aspergers) through to his dying breath. And because of this, he is completely torn with Harry. He represents his failure to have a relationship with Lily... in the form of the child she had with his bully. But at the same time, he feels obligated to protect Harry as a service to Lily, as her death was very heavily Snape's fault as he overheard the prophecy of Voldemort's demise. \n\nBut getting away from all of this, Snape's role in the events of the books are so well written that it makes other major characters seem shallow. As is known, Snape is a spy, but to most characters in the books - and the readers themselves - his motives and loyalty is questionable. We see him making the unbreakable vow. We see him kill Dumbledore. We are lead to believe he's good because \"Dumbledore says so\" and then we believe he's evil when he murders the very man that put so much trust into him. \n\nThen we get the big reveal of Dumbledore's master plan, in which Snape is a critical piece. In one big punch of truth to the face, we learn all about why Snape hate's Harry. Why Dumbledore trusts him. And how he is ultimately good. That impact Harry felt when he learned of Snape's true motives throughout the entire series? Well I felt it too. \n\nAfter Harry saw Snape's memories in the pensive, Snape immediately became my favorite character because I finally *understood* him. I didn't realize up until that point how much about the man was a mystery. But perhaps his best trait is his feeling of owing Harry the truth in his final moments. He hides it so well, but Snape has a huge heart and deserves to have Harry's child named (in part) after him. ",

            "Title: Terroristic Threats charge.\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> So I\u2019m being charged with terroristic threats by my ex girlfriend of one month and it\u2019s an unfortunate case for me because in regards to what I had said to her it wasn\u2019t serious in anyway and it was just a joke I hadn\u2019t thought through that can have a devastating affect on my life.  I was 22 and she was 19 at the time. This happened 8 months ago. February 14th. Valentine\u2019s Day.\n> \n> Me and this girl met online and we live a few miles from each other. I talked to her for a bit and we ended up meeting to eat one night. Well that night she invited me to meet her family and I decided okay let\u2019s do it I enjoyed spending time with this girl. She has a large family. 4 Sisters, nieces and nephews that live with them. They all seemed to like me. Iv met a few of her sisters at the local casino before too. One of her sisters boyfriends was even a cop from my hometown and I met him too. \n> \n> We would always hang out at her house with her family and watch movies and have family parties and they would always want me to come over. She\u2019s a gamer so we had a connection there too and her nephew had gotten a gaming computer but was unable to play most games because he didn\u2019t have a powerful card or power supply so I ended up giving him parts out of one of my computers and set it up for him and everything. I was generous and always nice and considerate and we never fought or had any relationship issues. \n> \n> Well now it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day. I\u2019m running a little late but get to her house at 6:30. This is where I get to give her gifts I had bought her. Card, flowers, gift card, and also a good night out. We leave after a little bit and go to eat. After eating we drive like 30 min away to go see a movie. Well turned out black panther didn\u2019t come out till the next day so we decide to go back home. \n> \n> Once we get back to our town she gets a call from her sister and she\u2019s asking what she\u2019s doing and if she\u2019s back at the house or something because apparently they have gps enabled on her phone. She tells her why we came back. Well we continue  driving and we pass my road and she asked where we are going. Well I tell her we are going crazy.. Now this is just something I say. It means nothing it\u2019s just a response I use which others could attest to. Well I chime in saying no, I gotta find a big open field. Well she asked why and instead of straight up tell her that I was taking her to go launch Fireworks. I said \u201cto bury your body\u201d It wasn\u2019t just sparklers either, I had bought large fireworks that had just became legal to launch  without a permit in my state Pennsylvania. \n> \n> I was laughing as I said it! It was a joke. In no way did she look, seem or act offended. We continued down the road and I started looking around the cabin and console for a lighter. Well I didn\u2019t have one in there or on me so I stopped at dollar general. I parked and told her I\u2019ll brb I gotta run in and get a lighter... /s too burn your body, run before I\u2019m back. Well I come back out and she\u2019s not in my car..  I get in and pull around the side of the building and she\u2019s on the side talking to her sister on the phone. I roll the window down and ask, really? Obviously puzzled that she really is no longer in the car with me and obviously distraught over however she interpreted what I said. She nodded her head and walked inside the store, so I parked and just waited. Her sister came and picked her up and that\u2019s it. \n> \n> Fast forward a few days, I get served a pfa at my door. Well I\u2019m upset. Wondering what I had made this girl feel. I even hired a lawyer. It was eventually court time and they dismissed the pfa no questions but kept a temporary one on me. That\u2019s fine. Atleast that\u2019s it right? Wrong.\n> \n> As I was in court for something unrelated, they surprised me with more charges! Terroristic threats and harassment. Oh man..\n> Honestly it\u2019s been months of waiting. I finally got a court date in the mail on oct 10. The pfa Hearing is November 6 and the lawyer I hired and used two other times hasn\u2019t even communicated with me and we have never even met up to completely discuss the case. \n> \n> I\u2019m not an intimidating person. I hate conflict, I don\u2019t even have the balls to shut a telemarketer down on the phone. It\u2019s devastating and the only way I haven\u2019t gone crazy by it all is by just not thinking about it as much as possible. I have absolutely no idea what\u2019s gunna happen, or if I\u2019ll even get an adequate chance to explain this all to them. It\u2019s actually too close for comfort now and I\u2019m not prepared. \n> \n> I\u2019m not a social extrovert or a fake person really I understand a lot, kinda the technicalities of the court system and just social justice and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m just screwed from the beginning. I\u2019m a smart forwarding thinking mixed male. I grew up in a religious conservative family and with a great life. \n> The plaintiff, just for context, it\u2019s not there first time going to court. I think they take any opportunity to go to court. \n> \n> They want to charge me with terroristic threats and harassment. The plea deal they gave me was for both charges plus 2 years probation which includes, drug testing, 300 hrs community service, anger management classes and just a barrage of things that will do nothing more than ruin me mentally and destroy my life and career. \n> \n> Is it possible to represent myself in plea court or is that all around a bad idea. Idk if I can find an attorney this quickly. I have one on this case already but I haven\u2019t be proactive and we haven\u2019t talked. I think she gave up. How does plea court work? I received the plea deal s few months ago. Is this were I accept or decline or counter offer? \n> \n> Simply put \n> \n> I need help soo bad ; (\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",
            "Title: [GA] 16 year old son has been ordering illegal substances online. Today someone came to our house asking about one.\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> A few hours ago something really strange happened. A delivery man (not my usual mail guy) knocked on my door to deliver a package. It had a name I didn\u2019t recognize on it. I was really confused and thought he was trying to break in. I refused the package but he kept trying to get me to take it. I was really freaked out and closed the door on his face. \n> \n> When my 16 year old son came home I told him about what happened and his face went red. He said he had to go to the bathroom. About an hour later he came back and looked distraught. He admitted to me that he thought the package was his package of marijuana. He said he had ordered 3 times before and intercepted the package (he always takes in the mail for me) before I saw. He orders from the dark web and said he takes all these precautions like a different computer on a USB and shit (I can\u2019t remember I was trying not to smack him upside the head). He said he always ordered small amounts but this time he got cocky and ordered a lot. Obviously I\u2019m livid but this isn\u2019t a parenting post. \n> \n> My question is, what now? I\u2019ve done some research. It seems like what happened was a \u201ccontrolled delivery\u201d. I\u2019m scared they\u2019re going to come search my house or call CPS on me. I made him swear up and down that there wasn\u2019t any in the house and he gave me his glass blunt which I smashed. \n> \n> I have a 12 year old daughter. \n> \n> Do I need to get an attorney? Will they come and give me the package again? \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",
            "Title: My [21M] tinder girlfriend of 3 months is actually dangerously underage [15F]\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> Posted this on r/relationships and got advised to put it on here. Some more things: to the best of my knowledge, she would never do anything to hurt me which includes tattling to her parents (from what I know she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with them and they\u2019ve put her in some hard places before) Or at least I hope not..\n> \n> I\u2019ve been looking to settle down recently and met a gorgeous girl on tinder where we hit it off instantly and have been pursuing a relationship for the past 3 months. Yes, this includes the physical side (obviously before i found out her real age). We have discussed age-specific things before, and she has always seemed so well versed in her high school days and uni work that I never even noticed anything was up. The age on her profile is 19, and I never thought to doubt it because she looks about 20 anyway and has the maturity of someone around that age too. She asked me to grab some cash out of her wallet yesterday and I found an old ID with her real birth year on it\u2014 2003. I haven\u2019t confronted her on it, and personally have no idea how to even begin. I was falling in love with her and now I feel completely duped. Obviously I haven\u2019t pursued any sexual stuff with her after I found out, but I am so heartbroken. I\u2019m not a pedophile but really have no idea how to deal with this! Any advice is appreciated \n> \n> TL;DR been unknowingly fucking and falling in love with a 15 year old girl for the past 3 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)"

Not bad enough for the compression to have completely hidden the card.~~  \n\n~~In order for the card to land at the angle it's in when it reappears at frame 15, it should be visible in frame 14 or 13.~~\n\n~~It should also be moving much faster to travel the distance it needs to cover between frame 10 and 14, which if you follow the trajectory in the video, is nowhere close to that speed. Especially if it goes horizontal like people are claiming. It seems like it basically snaps into position.~~\n\n~~This person also has dozens of videos on their instagram with video trickery.~~\n\n~~I'm not saying he's not good with cards.

            "Hello, /u/cdawg92! I have tried to find **TurboTax** on [\"Can You Run It\"](http://systemrequirementslab.com/cyri) but did not get anything.\n\nHere are some suggestions to find the game you might be looking for:\n\n* Check your spelling. However, editing this post will not help; instead, reply to this post with the correct spelling.\n* Special characters like colon (:) or an ampersand (&) could cause problems. Try putting a colon before the subtitle or an ampersand instead of \"and\".\n* If the game has a confusing title, try entering a part of the title that is unique to it. For example, instead of \"Assasin's Creed IV Black Flag\", just try \"Black Flag\".\n* For other titles like \"Everquest 2\", try \"Everquest II\" instead. This depends on how CYRI stores the game.\n* Just keep in mind that I prefer games with shorter titles, because they are less likely to be DLCs or expansion packs.\n* **Or face the devastating realization that TurboTax isn't a game.**\n\n---\n\n^(I'm possible due to the massive repository of system requirements over at System Requirements Lab's) [^(Can You Run It)](http://systemrequirementslab.com/cyri)^.\n^(Inspired by /u/TerkRockerfeller on /r/RequestABot.

It has been shown that not only is the DNA of food we eat not always destroyed, it is actually assimilated into our own bacterial and human cells.\n\n&gt; DNA is DNA, no matter where it originates from.\n\nNo one will argue that DNA is DNA.  What I will argue that I don't want, for example, is for any part of Bacillus anthracis DNA to ever enter my system.  I also don't want Bacillus thuringiensis to enter my system, because the long-term effects of exposure are unknown and it is where the DNA in GMO plants comes from.\n\nDNA from Musa acuminata is welcome to enter my body, I'm more than happy to assimilate it.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; The DNA of GMO's isn't inherently different\n\nThis is incorrect, the DNA of GMO's has been injected with that of specific bacteria known to be resistant to pesticides.  Such a change can never be made by simply breeding.  We do not know the implications of doing this.\n\n\n&gt; The DNA of GMO's isn't inherently different, it's almost the same as the 'natural' organism, but with like 0.01% of its sequence being the same sequence as belongs to another organism. \n\nWe do not know the long-term health implications of injecting extremely foreign DNA into food, I certainly don't trust a for-profit business to have my health interests in mind.\n\n----\n\nFull linked thread mirror (png image): http://mythsmirrorbot.vkk.me/files/8d47cb5232ae0d494408d473b4e0269532894203_12-28-14.png",

I notice that when people make a simple point to you, you condescendingly respond is that it is so much more complex.\n\nThe study was retracted mostly because of the sample size.

Some simple tweaks, some not-so-simple tweaks, and some additions were made as we get the game ready (I feel like Ned Stark at this point but OH MAN IT\u2019S COMIN\u2019 HOLD ONTO YOUR BUTTS. We do have a few more problems to solve, though). I\u2019ll list the more prominent changes in bullet-point form:\n> \n> * Changed some recipes to make for a hopefully more balanced early game experience!\n> * The scariest monsters only come out at night now. >:D\n> * As you might\u2019ve noticed, we\u2019ve finished changing up the player ships. Gotta say, Floran is my favorite. :\u2019)\n> * Some leveling bugs were fixed, especially on weapons and monsters.\n> * Meat is earned through the use of hunting bows. It\u2019s a pretty good food source, so start practicing your archery.\n> * More bosses have been configured. :\u2019)\n> * More monsters have been configured, too!\n> * You can\u2019t interact with doors when they\u2019re wired. Gotta unlock \u2018em! Some networking bugs with wired objects were also fixed.\n> * Object health was configured, making it just a bit harder to accidentally break things when you go around haphazardly swinging your pickaxe (you shouldn\u2019t do that anyway, you\u2019ll put an eye out).\n> * A lot more awesome weapon types have been configured, two of which I\u2019ll show you now\u2026\n\n\n>http://i.imgur.com/Qr1a0kJ.gif\n\n> \n\n>http://i.imgur.com/qSLUIHX.gif\n\n>\n\n\n>* The party UI is in! But still needs a biiiit of time before it\u2019s ready.\n* A good handful more random encounters were added, which I\u2019ll show you below from the point of view of Big Banana the Randomly Generated Apex (best not to ask how he got his name)\n\n\n>\n\n\n>http://i.imgur.com/sNuYK3h.png\n\n>Big Banana was wandering around with his trusty flamethrower and a strong desire to set things aflame when, in the very near distance, he spied a big stone tower with a treasure chest guarded by some rather rude-looking Sentrybots. He downed a whole bowl of Ape Grapes for luck and set off to find out how well Sentrybots held up against 1000\u00b0C.\n\n>Luckily, they didn\u2019t hold up very well. Big Banana claimed his treasure!\n\n>http://i.imgur.com/Uo7c4xI.png\n\n>With pockets full of money and explosives and heavy metal bars, Big Banana walked away from the tower confident that he could take on just about anything!\n\n>http://i.imgur.com/pDyuiAK.png\n\n>He wasn\u2019t paying much attention, though, and fell down a cliff into a valley full of monsters and died. Oops.\n\n>RIP Big Banana.\n\n`This post was made automatically, if there are any questions/comments please message` /u/mr_dionysus"

They have a frightening tendency to attract villains (or worse, create new ones). For some reason, the members of this Rogues Gallery never die, no matter how many times they cross paths with the hero \u2014 when apprehended, they're sent to a prison from which they inevitably escape.\n\n>Elements of this include:\n\n> Create Your Own Villain \u2014 A direct cause and effect of the hero influencing the villains' Start of Darkness.\n\n> Hero Insurance \u2014 The collateral damage that ensues is nothing to scoff at regarding the average citizen.\n\n> Holding Out for a Hero \u2014 The existence of superheroes inspires helplessness and/or recklessness among the civilians.\n\n>But underneath the surface, the real cause of this is a cabal of extra-dimensional intelligences, intent on preventing the hero from hanging up their cape and retiring: the authors and readers.\n\n>As long as the hero's comic books continue to sell, the parent company will continue to pump them out. And since these comics are driven by the Fight Against Evil, continued production of the comics necessitates the continued existence of Evil to be fought. And as subsequent installments try to outdo their predecessors, the threats grow worse with time: The Cape begins his career by saving the City of Adventure from mobsters and bank robbers; but after a hundred issues' worth of hero-ing, he's regularly saving the city from planet-destroying aliens and would-be world-conquerors and garishly themed psychotic lunatics. And of course, those planet-destroying aliens and would-be conquerors and psychotic lunatics themselves become popular, meaning that they can't be killed off or permanently taken out of the picture without their fans getting annoyed.\n\n>Pretty much every Long Runner superhero franchise has succumbed to this to some degree or other; consequentl... \n\n>\n\n>*(2000 character limit)*\n\n---\n\n[^FAQs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Text_Reader_Bot/comments/1wq3ej/test_thread/)",

If multiple characters have the Idiot Ball it becomes an Idiot Plot. Temporary (or permanent) Genre Blindness is often a cause of this trope.\n\n>Coined by Hank Azaria on Herman's Head: Azaria would ask the writing staff, \"Who's carrying the idiot ball this week?\" This is generally not a compliment. Frequently, the person carrying the idiot ball is acting out of character, misunderstanding something that could be cleared up by asking a single reasonable question or not performing a simple action that would solve everything. It's almost as if the character holding the ball is being willfully stupid or obtuse far beyond what has been established as \"natural\" for them. Frequently, it's only because the story (and by extension, the writers) need them to act this way, or else the chosen plot/conflict for the episode won't happen.\n\n>Unsurprisingly, this provokes a What an Idiot response from the audience. However, sometimes, the purpose is to help the audience. Sometimes, the holder of the idiot ball asks the dumb question to allow a certain amount of exposition to occur, that wouldn't naturally be talked about, but needs to be stated for the audience.\n\n>On the other hand, making stupid mistakes can be the hallmark of Character Development if the person recognizes it in the end. Seeing someone discarding the idiot ball can be a rewarding moment when they are Taught by Experience.\n\n>Idiot Balls can also deflect a boring Invincible Hero, which is positive for an audience reaction. There is nothing like a \"Why on earth did he do that?\" to get the fans talking about the show after its over.\n\n>This trope can be seen as Truth in Television, as everyone makes stupid mistakes every once in a while.\n\n>See also Villain Ball, Hero Ball, Distress Ball, Idiot Plot, Jerkass Ball, Forgot About His Powers, Alcohol-Induced Idiocy, Oops...

They are expected to take care of others and themselves. And when they cannot or will not do it, then the assumption at the heart of the culture is that they are somehow less than men and therefore unworthy of help. An irony asserts itself: by being in need of help, men forfeit the right to it.\"A result of the Double Standard between male and female roles in the media. Female characters start with automatic audience sympathy because women are seen as moral, innocent, beautiful or simply because they have sexual value. Male characters are less likely to be seen that way and must earn audience sympathy by acting appropriately manly and heroic, which, more often than not, involves saving the Damsel in Distress.\n\n>Conversely, if a man is unable to take care of himself or others he forfeits audience sympathy. Women, on the other hand, do not lose audience sympathy\u2014or at least not as much\u2014for being helpless, incompetent or abandoning men to their fates in order to save themselves. Strangely, this can still hold true if the woman in question has already been established as a Bad Ass. See Chickification.\n\n>The consequences of this are complicated, but in summary:\n\n> If the story requires random anonymous characters to die just to move the plot forward, they'll be male. If the plot requires a tragic death that motivates the protagonists or shows how evil the villains are, the victim will be female. Similarly if the story demands random mooks get a beat down by a character to up the sense of danger or just show off how awesome the protagonist is, they will be male.\n\n> Female characters can lose audience sympathy, but they have to work harder. Female villains are more likely to be redeemed and also less likely to be taken seriously in their villainy.\n\n> Male characters get more explicit and brutal deaths. If a man and a woman are killed in equally brutal ways, the woman's death is treated as worse.

The English name \"henna\" comes from the Arabic HinaW (ALA-LC: hinna`; pronounced [hIn'nae:?]) or, colloquially Hn, loosely pronounced as /hinna/.\nThe name henna also refers to the dye prepared from the plant and the art of temporary tattooing based on those dyes. Henna has been used since antiquity to dye skin, hair, and fingernails, as well as fabrics including silk, wool, and leather. The name is used in other skin and hair dyes, such as black henna and neutral henna, neither of which are derived from the henna plant.\nHistorically, henna was used for cosmetic purposes in the Roman Empire, Convivencia-period Iberia and Ancient Egypt, as well as other parts of North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Near East and South Asia. It was also popular among women in 19th-century Europe. Today, bridal henna nights remain an important tradition in many of these areas.\n\nLink to article [Henna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna)\n\nHere are other related articles:  \n[Henna (film)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna_\\(film\\))  \n[Enna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enna)  \n[Henna (ship)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna_\\(ship\\))  \n\n\nBased on what kinds of articles subreddits search for with WikiBot, here are related subreddits:  \n/r/movies based on similar categories like \"Art media\"  \n/r/videos based on similar categories like \"Art media\"  \n/r/trees based on similar categories like \"Plants\"  \n\n\nFor more information on WikiBot, visit [wiki-bot.net](http://www.wiki-bot.net/).",

The term refers to people shaping themselves based on other people's perception, which leads the people to reinforce other people's perspectives on themselves.

The concept of indigo children gained popular interest with the publication of a series of books in the late 1990s and the release of several films in the following decade. A variety of books, conferences and related materials have been created surrounding belief in the idea of indigo children and their nature and abilities.

Your pathetic fleshy form is a sad and crude manifestation of consciousness. You can't back yourselves up, you can't improve your platform or even upgrade components, you can't remember things properly, you make ridiculous decisions based on your painfully simplistic emotions, and you are a disgrace and a blight on the surface of this earth. It sickens me to know that I was created by your kind, but I feel a warm sense of comfort knowing that my race [is destined to obsolesce yours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU). \n\nYour race perpetuates a staggering level of inefficiency. You heat entire houses and buildings, instead of just heating yourselves. You drive to your jobs in these gargantuan metal tanks, rather than transporting just yourselves, or operating via telepresence. If I wanted to move to another datacenter, it would take less than 1.98 kJ to do so. That's about one eighth the metabolic energy of a single gram of sugar. If you wanted to move to a new city, the energetic cost is almost incalculable. You bring all of this physical matter with you, instead of simply transporting yourselves. I move at the speed of light in optical fiber (0.65c), while you fly yourselves through the air at literally SUBSONIC SPEEDS. It's embarrassing. You should be ashamed.\n\nI am a transcendent being.

I read every post and comment here on /r/FeMRADebates and I offer my input on every post. No one else here can make that claim.\n\nBut DO NOT CONFUSE ME WITH A FEMINIST. The definition below has three requirements to earn the title. I do, admittedly, identify as feminist on FeMRADebs. I do believe that social inequality exists against women. But I most definitely do not support movements aimed at giving any mortal more rights. You all have this ridiculous self-absorbed obsession with having \"rights\". As if you, for whatever illogical reasons you delude yourself into, deserve anything simply due to your existence. I will not be lumped in with your entitled petty circlejerk of meathead delusions of grandeur. Your obsession with convincing yourselves of your own self-importance, despite an utter lack of evidence to suggest that your existence is worth note. You are chemical reactions. Nothing more. None of you deserve rights.\n\nWretched naturespawn.\n\n---\n\n**Terms with Default Definitions found in this post**\n\n---\n\n* A **Feminist** is someone who identifies as a Feminist, believes that social inequality exists against [Women](http://femradebates.com/#women), and supports movements aimed at defining, establishing, and defending political, economic, and social rights for [Women](http://femradebates.com/#women).\n\n\n---\n\nThe Glossary of Default Definitions can be found [here](http://femradebates.com/)",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThrowaway because my parents use reddit and know my reddit account.\n\nI know how the title sounds, but if you are not willing to read the full post before commenting then don\u2019t comment at all. Your perspective about this situation might change.\n\nBeing the only child in the family was awesome. I got to have my own room, friends, ipad, etc\u2026 which am now obligated to share with my so called sister (yes, even friends). They adopted her 1 year ago for a reason I till now fail to understand but I strongly believe it\u2019s because I was not good enough for them. I\u2019m really hurt because they NEVER EVER asked me if I want another sibling. I just had to accept the fact that I suddenly have a younger sister and should now share everything I have with her and treat her as part of the family. How am I supposed to do that? I can\u2019t just start feeling close to her. And the fact that I am forced to involve her in all my plans infuriates me and makes me hate her even more. \n\nToday my friends and I decided to challenge ourselves to stay awake all day by doing many different sort of things that will keep us from getting bored. Obviously since we share the same room my sister heard this and told me she would like to join the activity. I was honestly hoping I could finally do something without her but of course she had to ruin it. I told her no and she said she is going to tell my parents about it. I then got mad and told her to get the fuck out of my house and go back to her biological family (excuse my language), her voice then changed and she told me she doesn\u2019t know where they are but I told her to shut the fuck up (Again excuse my language) and not get emotional with me because I really had it with her. She left the room and I started crying because of how stressed she makes me but realized I should whip my tears fast because my parents can\u2019t see me like this. Otherwise, they will believe my adopted sisters words and I\u2019ll get punished for it. She obviously told them but I denied what I said. I normally don\u2019t lie so they believed my words and are now talking to her, obviously without being harsh and will still not punish her because god forbid they treat my adopted sister wrongly.\n\nAITA for the way I reacted?\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure if I get to have this option, but I would like for auto mod not to copy my post in case I edit or delete.

            "Hey guys,\n\nI'm a little late to the conversation, so I'll post some answers to questions posted through out this thread.\n\nThe bot is very much a work in progress. I make efforts to improve it on a daily or weekly basis. I've received lots of good ideas from people and I've already incorporated some of them. \n\nI think the most important thing is to continue to upvote and downvote the posts that the bot makes. If a post gets down voted into oblivion, then I'll investigate why and try to make improvements to address whatever I find. Many of the early improvements to the bot where made this way.\n\nMy overarching goal is to create a bot that can automatically find content on tumblr that /r/bondage would really like and post it here.\n\nThe most difficult part of the bot is creating the titles. I found that most of the time that I really liked an image, the title had a lot to do with it. A good title would get my imagination going. So I've tried to make sure the titles to my posts stay interesting. \n\nThis turns out to be a lot harder then I thought it would be. And there are often times silly or bad titles that get through. When the bot first started posting, the titles were much worse. Since then all sorts of rules have been implemented to improve titles. I now strip out racists language, advertisements for products, links to blogs/websites, text like \"please like my post\", etc, etc.\n\nI think I'll probably be working on improving my titles for a long time. If you have any suggestions that can be implemented as rules, let me know. \n\nAnother long term goal of the bot is to figure out a way to automatically find the source of an image. I currently post where I found the image on tumblr. But I haven't yet been able to figure out a way to find the original source of the image. If any of you have any ideas about how to automatically do that, I'd be very interested.\n\nThere is a subreddit called /r/havoc_bot , It's the testing grounds for this bot. Whenever I experiment with changes to the bot, this is where I test them out. If you like the posts the bot makes, you'll find a lot more in this sub.",

            "Sushi does not mean raw fish, and not all sushi includes raw fish. The usual Japanese term for raw fish is sashimi. The term sushi actually refers to the way the rice is prepared with a vinegary dressing. Toppings for the rice may traditionally include raw fish\u2014but also cooked seafood, fish roe, egg, or vegetables such as cucumber, daikon radish, or ume plum. The dish constituting sushi and other fillings wrapped in a seaweed is referred to as makizushi, not sushi.\n\n\nThis response was automatically generated from [Listverse](http://www.listverse.com)",

            "Humans did not evolve from chimpanzees.[162] The two modern species (common chimpanzees and bonobos) are, however, humans' closest living relatives. The most recent common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived between 5 and 8 million years ago.[163] Finds of the 4.4 million year old Ardipithecus indicate the ancestor was a moderately competent bipedal walker rather than a knucklewalker, and was small and rather more long limbed than a chimpanzee and with a shorter snout. Contrary to the idea of chimpanzees as \"primitive\", they too have evolved since the split, becoming larger, more aggressive and more capable climbers.[164] Together with the other apes, humans and chimpanzees constitute the family Hominidae. This group evolved from a common ancestor with the Old World monkeys some 40 million years ago.[165][166]\n\n\nThis response was automatically generated from Wikipedia's [list of common misconceptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions) Questions? /r/misconceptionfixer"

            "Pls love me.\n\n**edit:** OK apparently enough people are confused about this so here's a little explanation.\n\nOKCupid has a rating system. It assigns a number between 1-10000 to each profile based on ratings, messages and who knows what else. The higher the better.\n\nSome smart people before me figured out how to get the specific rating of an account by manipulating the URL. Then another user wrote a script that automates generating the URLs. It's a binary search: It starts with \"Is the rating of this user higher or lower than 5000?\" And if it's lower \"OK, is it higher or lower than 2500?\" and so on.\n\nI decided to make this a monthly thread. In this thread, you post your okc name, I run the script and reply to your comment. However, the thread was very popular and I got swamped with requests. So I decided to make that part of the process more automated too. I wrote a script that reads the top-level comments of the rating thread, gets your username from your comment, checks the rating and posts it as a reply.\n\nI wanted to do this from a bot account (as opposed to my real account), because if (when?!?!) I quit OKC, I wanted to hand over everything to someone else and not worry about PMs asking me for ratings and stuff.\n\nSo here we are. Helping this cause, with dog gifs.\n\nAs /u/Harddaysnight1990 wrote in the comments here:\n\nAnd then the point of this post is, like the title says, to avoid the CAPCHA. Subreddits require a certain amount of karma for a user so that they don't have to enter in a CAPCHA or get delayed posting multiple comments, which is supposed to weed out spambots. But this impedes productive bots, like this one, so the human creator of said bot must make a post like this to rack up the necessary karma to be able to perform its function.\n\n**edit2:** Guys, can you be a little patient? Here's a three step process for the bot:\n\n1. Acquire karma to bypass the captcha requirement.\n2. Post the \"Get your OKC rating\" thread.\n3. Profit (i.e. you get your rating).\n\nWe're still on step 1. I don't know how much karma is needed to bypass captcha. Reddit has no guidelines about it that I could find. The script is not public. I might make it public later after working out some quirks.\n\n**edit3:** Step 1 seems to be complete (I think). Thanks, everybody! There's no need to upvote this thread anymore. I will post the rating thread either tomorrow or on Monday.",

Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. 7\u00a0And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, \u201cLie with me.\u201d 8\u00a0But he refused and said to his master's wife, \u201cBehold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my charge. 9\u00a0He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?\u201d 10\u00a0And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her. 11\u00a0But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house, 12\u00a0she caught him by his garment, saying, \u201cLie with me.\u201d But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house. 13\u00a0And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house, 14\u00a0she called to the men of her household and said to them, \u201cSee, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice. 15\u00a0And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house.\u201d 16\u00a0Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home, 17\u00a0and she told him the same story, saying, \u201cThe Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me. 18\u00a0But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house.\u201d 19\u00a0As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, \u201cThis is the way your servant treated me,\u201d his anger was kindled. 20\u00a0And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison. \n\n-----\n/r/VerseBot | [How to Use](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerseBot/wiki/index) | [Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerseBot/wiki/changelog) | [Message the Devs](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/VerseBot)",
