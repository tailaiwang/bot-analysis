I don't know what your relationship is with your sibling but maybe being gifted with the responsibility of directly caring for your dog will help them grow a bond with him the way you have?  That was the case for a kid we hosted in our home recently.  Until he was responsible for morning and evening meals, he didn't really invest in getting to know our pups. Their meal-time acrobatics and appreciation broke through his seeming apathy for animals.\n\nChecking in with your sib by text to ask after silly dog antics and asking for pics will maybe help them (and you) feel connected while you're away too.  A heart to heart with them about how worried you are and asking for them to care for your 4-legged friend in your absence might help them see this as a gift to you and not just a chore.\n\nThat all said, dogs are super resilient.  He will likely get depressed while you're gone (another thing your sib might be able to see and emotionally respond to) but he'll survive your loss.  3 months isn't all that long and dogs don't relate to time the same way we people do.  When I've had to leave my pets with parents or siblings over the years (we used to do overseas tours) it was frankly harder on me than them.

We\u2019ll share any updates on this as we have them.\n\nEdit:  Just to clarify, we don\u2019t share gender or similar account data - we use industry-standard practices to share things like ad conversion rates with advertisers.\n\nYou can read more about how we treat user data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy).",
            "We have no plans at this time to link gender identity in [settings](https://www.reddit.com/settings/profile) to your public profile (longer form guide to that [here](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043471231-How-do-I-update-my-profile-settings-)), though redditors are welcome to share as much or as little information about themselves as they choose to in their profiles.",
            "Sharing gender with Reddit is an opt-in process either during sign up or at any time within your account settings. The purpose of this announcement is to let redditors who have already selected their gender on Reddit know that they can opt out ahead of this change.",
            "Right now, advertisers will only be able to target male and female gender identities. We are committed to ensuring that advertisers cannot use our products and services in a way that is discriminatory or violates the law. Reddit has processes in place, including automation and human review, to mitigate bias and discrimination on our platform. You can read more about our targeting policies [here](https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Targeting-Guidelines#:~:text=Advertisers%20are%20not%20allowed%20to%20use%20their%20own%20data%20or,under%20the%20age%20of%2018).",
            "If you select Denmark and those communities that will make the targeting an AND statement, meaning the people on Reddit have to be in Denmak AND interested in r/Denmark r/DanskMemes ect. So this would actually make the targeted audience smaller. If you just target Denmark you would be targeting just the country. If on the other hand you just target those subreddits, you're reaching people interested in those communities. They may be subbed or engaging with content around it, etc. A good way to start I'd say is to just run your ads to Denmark and see how those perform and if they meet your expectations. You can always test the subreddits as well and compare performance."

This allows you to keep the context of the conversation and report posts/comments if needed. Keeping content accessible allows you to protect yourself from harassment that would otherwise be unseen. Note that group chats are an exception, if you are in a group chat with a blocked user, all users in that chat will be able to see your replies. We have set up reminders in any group chats that contain a blocked user to make sure this stays top of mind.\n\n**People who have been blocked:** You will not have the option to have 1:1 contact or see content from the user who has blocked you. Content from users who have blocked you will appear deleted. As such, you will not be able to reply to or award users who have blocked you.\n\n**Moderators who have blocked:** Same experience as regular users, but when you are in your community you will still see users who you have blocked without the interstitial so you can safely block without jeopardizing moderation.\n\n**Moderators who have been blocked:** Same experience as regular users, but when you post and distinguish yourself as a mod in your community, users who have blocked you will be able to see your content. Additionally, you will be able to see the content of a user who has blocked you when they post or comment in a community that you moderate. When viewing user profiles, you will be able to see the history of a user who has blocked you within the communities you moderate. For example, since I mod r/redditrequest, even if you blocked me, I could see all of your past activity solely in r/redditrequest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor more information, see Reddit Help articles: [How Does Block Work](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413520308372-How-does-blocking-work-) and [How Does Blocking Work for Moderators.](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4417201214989-How-does-blocking-work-for-moderators-)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: formatting",

This has come up quite a bit, so I\u2019ll summarize what I\u2019ve talked about on earlier posts. \n\nAs Reddit has grown, the NSFW tag has become too vague and you\u2019re not the only redditor who has asked for a way to distinguish between porn and gore. To evolve this system, we\u2019ve been working with mods to create new content tags with more nuance and test them to make sure they feel right for their communities. \n\nWe\u2019ve posted about this a couple times in r/modnews and gathered feedback from redditors and mods along the way to improve the tags. (Here\u2019s the [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hoac3v/keeping_reddit_real_subreddit_content/), [second post](https://new.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ikpgpp/an_update_on_subreddit_classification_efforts/), and [most recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/k60vti/another_update_on_subreddit_classification_efforts/) outlining the progress and next steps if you\u2019re curious.) Currently, tags are only available to mods that are in the test, but you can learn more about the tags and let us know what you think on the last [classification update in r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/k60vti/another_update_on_subreddit_classification_efforts/).",

She is trying to control your choices and actions, and won't let you do anything without her. This is the opposite of a healthy relationship. If she is acting this way towards you, chances are she is doing other unhealthy things as well, such as gaslighting you about topics or being overly dependent on you. She may be co-dependent or disrespectful. She may be stalking your social media, or telling you who you can or can not be friends with. Not saying all these things are necessarily true, but I'm naming them in case you need someone to point out negative behaviors that you may be overlooking in your love for her.",

Baker later revealed that he was urged by Harvey Milk, one of the first openly gay elected officials in the U.S., to create a symbol of pride for the gay community. Baker decided to make that symbol a flag because he saw flags as the most powerful symbol of pride. As he later said in an interview, \u201cOur job as gay people was to come out, to be visible, to live in the truth, as I say, to get out of the lie. A flag really fit that mission, because that\u2019s a way of proclaiming your visibility or saying, \u2018This is who I am!\u2019\u201d Baker saw the rainbow as a natural flag from the sky, so he adopted eight colors for the stripes, each color with its own meaning (hot pink for sex, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for art, indigo for harmony, and violet for spirit).\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/story/how-did-the-rainbow-flag-become-a-symbol-of-lgbt-pride](https://www.britannica.com/story/how-did-the-rainbow-flag-become-a-symbol-of-lgbt-pride)",

Further, it is used to make the broader point that liberals are \"out of touch\" and \"don't understand biology.\" This is not so. HRT changes a person's biology and this has carryover effects on athletic performance. Still, most studies DO SHOW some retained strength and athletic advantages in trans women after HRT, though these studies were largely conducted on individuals that started hormone therapy later in life - ie, after initially undergoing male puberty.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that every trans woman is going to out-compete cis women. At the level of high school sport we probably need to have a conversation about **inclusion vs overall fairness**. Statistically, most trans women are not going to automatically be the standout athlete dominating their sport. We just see the cases that are pushed into headlines.\n\nAnd here's the study that I'm referencing on this.\n\n[https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/11/577.full?ijkey=yjlCzZVZFRDZzHz&keytype=ref](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/11/577.full?ijkey=yjlCzZVZFRDZzHz&keytype=ref)\n\nEdit: Lotta people missing the point here and there are probably ways to balance inclusion and fairness.

            "This is a case report of a single 76 year old man with multiple comorbidities including Parkinsons, aspiration pneumonia, and severe arteriosclerosis that developed a relatively rare neurologic disease in multifocal necrotizing encephalitis after receiving his third vaccination. This case report shows evidence of spike protein (the viral antigen used to create current mRNA-based vaccines) but no evidence of virus itself as there was no viral nucleocapsid.\n\nThere are a few ways to interpret this case report.\n\n1) First, the antigen used in mRNA-based vaccines (which is also present in much larger quantities in actual infection) seems to generate robust immune responses in endothelial tissue. This might (in rare cases) injure these tissues. We've seen a similar phenomenon in vaccine-induced myocarditis, which is a real but very very rare event. This gentleman might have been predisposed to endothelial injury due to existing arteriosclerosis and abnormal brain tissue due to Parkinsons.\n\n2) Second, this is a very old man with multiple existing comorbidities. Given that millions and millions of people have received this vaccination, some people will get sick around the same time.\n\n3) Third, there's an ongoing attempt to discredit vaccines everywhere on the internet run by a combination of conspiratorial thinkers, true believers, and bad-faith grifters making money on sowing discord. This study appears legitimate, but it's important to consider this as well.\n\n**TL;DR:** Older gentleman with many comorbidities experiences rare and catastrophic neurologic disorder after a third vaccination dose. This potentially warrants further study in persons with severe artery disease and/or existing neurologic disorders.",

We all need to be aware of this and, like it or not, we'll have to find a way to work together.\n\nEdit: A bit more reading on [Doomerism](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/27/climatologist-michael-e-mann-doomism-climate-crisis-interview) and the tactics of [Disinfo](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2022/05/on-climate-doomism-heart-mind-reasons-to-resist-it/) here.",
            "I\u2019ll take the bait. I strongly disagree. Barefoot and minimalist running may not have lasted per se, but it ushered in a new era of low drop trainers. Prior to 2011 most running shoes were only available in 10-12mm drops, whereas now you have major companies offering zero and low drop options. Altra is one of the biggest companies in trail running today, and they are exclusively zero drop.\n\nI\u2019ll also add that there are still many folks who do well with minimalist footwear. A forefoot strike leads to more pronounced eccentric activation of the calf for shock absorption. And there\u2019s still data that a minimalist style reduces impact forces. Personally, I also find it to be much more fun. Heel striking feels like clomping to me."

He has two best selling books: one is a self-help book, the other is basically about how people create meaning and truth through stories and religion (a topic he debated atheist neuroscientist Sam Harris about in two podcast episodes and three live debates around the world).\n\nPeterson came to prominence from his YouTube channel after he got media attention for objecting to Canada's Bill C-16 (Titled: \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\"), which he called \"compelled speech\" inspired by \"marxist post-modernism\" because of its potential legal penalties for using politically incorrect language. ([Peterson's appearance at a Canadian Senate hearing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnIAAkSNtqo))\n\nC-16 according to Parliament: \n\n>The bill is intended to protect individuals from discrimination within the sphere of federal jurisdiction and from being the targets of hate propaganda, as a consequence of their gender identity or their gender expression. The bill adds \"gender identity or expression\" to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the list of characteristics of identifiable groups protected from hate propaganda in the Criminal Code. It also adds that evidence that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on a person's gender identity or expression constitutes an aggravating circumstance for a court to consider when imposing a criminal sentence.\n\nPeterson's critics said that he was not interpreting the bill correctly, and that no one could be jailed for misgendering a trans person, for instance; however, other critics simply attacked him for objecting to the bill as he interpreted it, saying that he was a conservative transphobe. Various contentious media appearances such as [this one on Britain's Channel 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54) went viral after the media started to notice his rising popularity, which they tended to describe as \"angry young men.\"  \n\n**Why is he in the news right now?**\n\n[As you likely gleaned from submissions on Reddit](https://nypost.com/2020/02/08/jordan-peterson-recovering-from-tranquilizer-addiction-in-russia/), he recently checked himself into rehab to help get off of the anti-anxiety medications he was on, which he became dependent on at the height of his fame after his wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\nRecent reports from [his family](https://youtu.be/DTwEFa5NW2k) say that he was suicidal, was misdiagnosed, had complications, was dissatisfied with North American facilities, felt he had to detox without drugs, went to Russia, had complications from pneumonia, was close to death, was put in a medically-induced coma, and now has serious physiological damage [which some speculate will be permanent], but is recovering.\n\nMany progressives online are using this as an opportunity to attack a political rival that they consider to have a cult following; others are calling him a hypocrite for being a self-help author and psychologist who is not psychologically healthy; others are simply throwing around theories based on what little we know, because (1) going to Russia to undergo controversial procedures is an unusual move, and (2) he and his daughter both claim to have rare autoimmune diseases ~~that are cured by~~ with negative affects that are significantly decreased by a meat-only diet, which makes many people skeptical of his family's claim that American and Canadian doctors weren't best-suited to help him. It's a unique series of events, to say the least.",
            "Answer: This happens every summer. Lori Lightfoot tried to address it with a curfew and by raising the bridges, reducing the number of exits and entrances from \"The Loop\" (the center of the city). Raising the bridges earned her hatred from the activists in Chicago who have now helped Brandon Johnson to win the mayor's race. Meanwhile, Chicago's state's attorney Kim Foxx tends not to prosecute a lot of the cases the Chicago Police Department puts in front of her, so kids, especially, but young adults, as well, are confident that even if they are one of the few in the mob to be arrested, they will likely be released.\n\nSources: \n\n* https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/02/19/lightfoot-says-raising-bridges-this-summer-was-right-decision-and-doesnt-rule-out-doing-it-again/\n\n* https://cwbchicago.com/2022/01/he-didnt-even-spend-time-in-prison-for-his-6th-felony-gun-conviction-now-hes-charged-with-his-7th.html\n\n* https://cwbchicago.com/2021/12/62-convicted-felon-on-bail-for-gun-case-tried-to-kill-2-chicago-cops-on-christmas-eve-prosecutors-say.html\n\n* https://news.wttw.com/2022/09/01/expanded-curfew-law-backed-lightfoot-used-just-4-times-amid-stepped-enforcement-push-data\n\nNew source added to clarify that expanded curfew regulations went into effect in 2021 after a teen was killed in Millennium Park. It was not related to Floyd \"protests.\" Bridges were technically a separate thing, but while they may have seemed directed at \"protests\" I think the looting and riots going on had more in common with these \"teens\" acting out than with protesters making their voices heard. (\"Teens\" is in shock quotes because this happens after the late bars empty out, as well.) I'm not convinced the looting on the Mag Mile was done by the same people who were, say, holding signs in the afternoon. There were a lot of social media posts about these flash mobs, and they seemed opportunistic.",

His first books were about the dangers of religion, and he came to prominence from [high-profile debates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eybI2MlmOUg&t=10m38s) against Christians, on the side of [Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7IHU28aR2E) and others.

            " **\"unless there\u2019s a compelling reason not to do so\"**",
            "Last week, I revealed here at Mysterious Universe that back in 2012, I was given the extensive files, notes, correspondence and archives of the late UFO researcher Kathy Kasten. I also noted that, as Kathy's files show, much of her research was focused upon studying claims that one of the people who was brought in to study the mysterious bodies reportedly found outside of Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947, was William Randolph Lovelace II - a man with a prestigious background and who worked with both the U.S. military and NASA.But, there is something else about those fascinating files I inherited: repeated references (specifically in relation to the curious corpses found on the Foster Ranch, Lincoln County) to legends concerning the legendary \"Ant People.\" And, if you're not aware of the controversy, you'll likely say: \"Huh? Ant People?\" Okay, let me explain.The story of the Ant People is an integral part of the legend, history, and mythology of the Hopi Indians of northern Arizona. Hopi lore tells of how, in times long, long gone, the Earth underwent a series of terrible cataclysms (or cycles) that manifested in the forms of Ice Ages, massive floods, and possibly even calamitous polar tilts.So the story goes, the Hopi might well have been exterminated when the world was in massive flux, were it not for assistance given to them by a race of diminutive, mysterious, humanoid beings. They were said to live deep underground, in certain parts of the American southwest. They were, of course, the Ant People.According to the legends, for the most part the Ant People kept away from the Human Race - which was largely oblivious to the existence of the strange world deep below them. On occasion, however, the Ant People would surface, and also on occasion, offer help to people. Thus, bit by bit, the Ant People became known and the legends duly began.It's important to note that they weren't called the Ant People just because they lived underground, in extensive, deep, winding tunnels. No. It was also because despite being humanoid, they somewhat physically resembled ants and particularly so in terms of their faces and their spindly limbs. Of course, one doesn't have to be a genius to know that some of the so-called \"Grays\" of alien abduction lore superficially look insect-like. You have probably already surmised where I am going with all this.Let's backtrack: thanks to a number of \"interesting\" sources, Kathy Kasten was hot on the trail of the William Randolph Lovelace/Roswell bodies connection.

            "He abused his daughter, Lisa Jobs, after he re-adopted her\n\nsummary Credit u/ RelevantMarketing [this sub doesn't allow user name mentions I think ]. But if you're planning on reading the book, skip this\n\nHighlights:\n\n-They made Lisa sleep on the first floor next to the kitchen while the rest of the family slept on the top floor. Initially she was the only child and all the rooms upstairs were empty but they still made her sleep on the first floor. One by one the other kids were born from Steve and Laurene Powell and were given rooms on the 2nd floor. The first floor had broken heating and she was constantly cold, while everyone upstairs enjoyed heating. Its California, but keep in mind that she's a petite girl who reached and adult height of 5'2\", and it is the Bay Area where in the winter temp would reach in the 40's \u00b0F. She would constantly beg Steve to fix the heating, he always refused\n\n-Every time she would start excelling at extra-circular activities, her Dad would complain that she was not spending enough time with her family. He was say stuff like 'You know Lisa, I feel that you really don't want to be a part of this family'. When Lisa quit her activities to be with her family more, him and his wife Laurene would just give her Reed Jobs (their son, only a baby at the time) to babysit, and they would go out to some party or event\n\n-They finally invite Lisa to come to a wedding. She was excited about it and planned for weeks about enjoying an event with her dad and step mom. She got a dress and everything. At the hotel room, after she's finished getting dressed and putting on her makeup, they hand her the baby and leave her behind to babysit in the hotel room while they enjoy the wedding\n\n-She always wanted a NeXT computer like how Steve and Laurene each had one. Steve finally got her one, but when she tried it didn't work. Steve took it away, and never replaced it. This one may seem minor, but it's actually a part Steve's habit of dangling hope in front of her, and taking it away, like with the wedding (my interpretation, not hers)\n\n-When she was at her Mom's house (which was Steve's, he owned the house), Steve hired a child molester to be the gardener. I don't think he was ever convicted so her Mom couldn't remove him. But he was accused by his own children. Her Mom would constantly scream and cry for Steve to remove him. He refused.\n\n-Btw, if you are wondering where her Mom is in all this, and why Steve let Lisa live with her if he hated her so much: Lisa's mom was also emotionally unstable; Lisa was often the victim of her temper tantrums, because she felt that Lisa took away her life. Lisa confided this to her school counselor, who would tell Steve, who didn't care. Finally the school counselor threatened to call social services if Steve didn't do anything, which would be a PR nightware, so he begrudgingly took her in. From reading other books on Steve, if he's forced to do something, he does it very passive aggressively. From Lisa's book, it seems his abuse towards Lisa was like 'ok you forced me to take in Lisa, but you can't force me to give in to your ultimate demand of her being treated properly' (my interpretation, not hers)\n\n-Steve told Lisa he would take her in, but only if he had cut all contact with her Mom for 6 months, to prove to him that she really wants to be a part of his family (A line Steve repeatedly used on Lisa to manipulate her into doing things didn't want to do, and quitting things she did like doing, like cutting school for a family vacation 2 weeks before finals). Even though Lisa had a fucked up relationship with her Mom, she still loved her\n\n-Cutting of contact with her Mom for 6 months fucked up the Mom emotionally even more, though she initially welcomed the change, saying that she needs a break from her (my interpretation was that she didn't want her to feel guilt for her decision). But the cutoff did have a effect on the Mom's already fragile psyche. When they met for dinner after the 6 months, her mom out of nowhere threw a tantrum about how Lisa abandoned her, that all she wants to do is hangout with rich people. I believe Lisa was only 9 years old when she had to endure this\n\n-Lisa's chores included dishes, but they refused to fix the dishwasher for years. One day she had the initiative to fix it on her own. While her parents were away, she got a repairman to find the problem, turned out to be a 40$ fix. She was really proud of herself. She told Steve hoping to finally impress him. When she told him, he frowned. The next day he replaced the dishwasher with a new one. He wanted to remove all artifacts of Lisa's accomplishments (my interpretation, not hers)\n\n-Lisa got really into debate club. At her first big regional tournament, she got first place. Tied for first place actually. The first one to the podium would get the trophy. Lisa frantically rushed there because she wanted to show Steve the trophy to impress him (at the time, Lisa thought only if she impressed Steve enough, he would start to appreciate her). When she showed him the trophy, he made her quit. His excuse was that debate club is not useful in the real world , my interpretation is that he wanted to remove anything that would giver her a semblance of self-esteem (my interpretation, not hers)\n\n-Whenever Steve would see a homeless person, he joked that's who Lisa is going to marry. Whenever he saw a strip club, he joked that's where Lisa is going to work. The strip club joke started when she 9 years old\n\n-Lisa's therapist invited Steve and his 2nd wife Laurene Powel to a meeting with Lisa to get them to spend quality family time with Lisa. Lauren's response was 'sorry Lisa, but we're just cold people'. After they left, the therapist told Lisa something like 'that's pretty much what I expected'\n\n-Lisa developed an eating disorder when Steve told her she was fat\n\n-When Lisa was in college, Steve Jobs cut off Lisa's tuition. A family friend secretly played off the tuition\n\n-Steve, when he only had a few weeks to live, did actually apologize to Lisa. Lisa told Laurene, she downplayed this, telling Lisa \"I don\u2019t believe in deathbed revelations\"\n\nThat's not even a full list, but this writing this part put me in a really bad mood and I'm going to stop now\n\nThe book probably doesn't even get to the worst of it. Her Mom said \"She didn't go into how bad it really was, if you can believe that\"\n\nEdit\n\nSince people are asking if Lisa was sexually abused, so I'll just post the parts which may be relevant\n\n-In one part of the book when Lisa was still a child, Steve and Laurene were making out and Steve reached under her skirt as she spread her legs, and another hand on her breast, she started moaning loudly. Lisa stood up to go away and Steve told her to stay and that they're having 'a family moment' and so she sat back down, facing away, but still listening to them moan\n\n-Steve Jobs encouraged Lisa to masturbate in the bathtub and have safe sex. I think when she was 13 or 14\n\n-This is not in Lisa's book, but in his Mom's book, A Bite From the Apple by Chrisann Brennan. That one time when Chrisann came to pickup up Lisa from Steve Job's house, she found Steve making sexually inappropriate jokes, and after that she had to make sure that there was another adult present with them. I think this was in the period when Steve accepted Lisa back into his life, but before Chrisann's mental breakdown where Lisa had to move in with Steve\n\nAgain, not a complete list from the book. And the book doesn't even get into the worst of it according to Chrisass Brennan\n\nFinally, please read the book. It is beautifully written. It's a coming of age story. Checkout this review from Audible\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsv0FZOWO8c Supposedly Laurene tried to get Barnes and Nobles, Audible, Goodreads, any major book platform, not to feature this book. (She did the same thing with the 2015 Steve Jobs movie, first trying to prevent it from it getting made). I'm not sure what came of Laurene's efforts, but I like to think that Laurene actually drew attention of Audible to the book, and then Audible loved it so much they taped that video review and put it on youtube\n\nEdit 2\n\nWhile I have everyone's attention, some more facts regarding Steve Dying of cancer\n\nHe ignored his doctor's advice for years, thinking he could cure his cancer with fruit. Because he's a raging egomaniac who thinks just because he's Steve Jobs, he's better than everyone\n\nBy the time steve agreed to a transplant, it was way too late, he used his money and influence to get on the waitlist for a transplant. Someone who actually could have had their life saved died, because Steve was rich and they were not\n\nNot only that, the transplant waitlist is based on geography. So Steve Jobs bought houses in every waitlist location so he could get on all of them at once. Once again, someone who did everything right died, while steve and his raging ego did everything wrong got the transplant was rich and they were not\n\nFinally, Tim Cook offered to donate his own. Steve Jobs said 'I couldn't do that to you' and everyone in the room laughed. Steve Jobs could have bypassed all these ethical issues and taken Tim Cook, but instead, decided just to let another non-rich person die and use the donation of another rich person, rather than let a rich person be a donor\n\nEdit 3\n\n>Brennan-Jobs also said Jobs sometimes walked out of restaurants without paying the bill and mocked her cousin's \"awful\" voice. Still, she does admit that she had felt a \"quaking, electric love\" for her father\n\nhttps://money.cnn.com/2018/08/28/technology/laurene-powell-jobs-statement/index.html\n\nAlso, in the book, Lisa describes that Steve went on a full on temper tantrum on a kid. He first got annoyed with him for eating meat. Then started yelling at him at the top of his lungs for eating too loudly. The kid was a part of their group, I believe one of his employees kids, he wasn't a random kid",

However the offices are being turned into \"collaboration hubs\" - we'll go in for meetings, workshops, training and so on. To me, it sounds like the best possible scenario - you get the \"good bits\" of working in an office, without the bad bits.\n\nThey've been massively supportive of home workers, shipping IT equipment and even furniture to employees who need it.\n\nI love it.

Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? 31 Now eagerly desire the greater gifts. ... 14:39 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.\n\nThe gifts of the Holy Spirit are as active today as they were in the early church."

All of them are likely to begin building more and I anticipate Netflix will be acquired for a major sum of money in the very near future by one of them or a new player such as Cox.\n\nI track these companies and place them in order of their threat to Net Neutrality.

Since websites like YouTube, Google, etc... offer essentially the same services in each country with small modifications for language they could simply decide to give everyone a uniform experience worldwide. Meaning if the Google News or an RSS reader or Facebook or Reddit can't display content to EU users as links to a news website then they will just stop providing links to content altogether for everyone.\n\nThis will also adversely impact Reddit, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo, Imgur, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Amazon, eBay, literally every fucking site on the internet. Nothing is exempted from content filtering either, it doesn't appear to just be 'uploaded' content but anything 'posted' which could include comments like this one, emails, and private conversations.

I'm saying there are many who hate her strictly because of sexism. But There are legit reasons to dislike her. \n\nOnce thing that really alienated democrats was Hillary's persistent hatred for Bernie. \n\nEven 2 years ago she was like 'Nobody likes him'. \n\nHer supporters in the DNC were caught favoring Hillary. Hillary made Debbie Wassermann Schulz her campaign chair the day she resigned for favoring Hillary in the DNC. \n\nHillary Clinton close associates, Neera Tandem and Debbie Wassermann Schultz both physically assaulted Bernie Supporters. \n\nHillary's associates in the democratic party still have an intense hatred for Bernie; they threw a Bernie is Over party after he lost the nomination the 2nd time. \n\nHillary insinuated Bernie is to blame for her loss to Trump in her Book. Hillary complained about Bernie taking long to concede, when she did the same thing to Obama, and it was so bad Michelle Obama called her out on this in her book, the only democrat criticized in  her entire book. \n\nHillary Clinton was horrible to Obama, yet Obama still reached out to her. Hillary fanned the flamed of racist sleeper cell conspiracies when her team dug up that Obama once said he wanted to run for president in an elementary school essay, and Hillary tried to attack him for it. Also, Hillary was radio silent when one her prominent supporters started spreading birtherism conspiracies.  Obama still reached out to her after the election. You would think she of all people knew the importance of building a coalition after winning the nomination. Something every single presidential candidate has done in modern history, with the exceptions being Trump and Clinton, and even then, Trump did a slightly better job. \n\nCompare this to Biden, after he got the nomination he reached out to Bernie and his supporters.",
            "you should see my fiction where Superman didn't want to eat Lois' butt, so she puts kryptonite in his food. When he finds out he's like 'quick where's the anti-kryptonite??' and she stands up, turns around, lifts up her skirt and spreads her cheeks and says 'riiight here' because she laced her butthole with the last remaining anti-kryptonite.\n\n\n\nSo in comic book #321 after Superman's finishes eating Lois Lane's ass, General Zod , Faora-Ul, and Quex-Ul attack, and superman springs into action. And he beats them easily.. too easily. He finds outs that eating ass gives him super duper powers beyond his current powers. Lois Lane pretended that's what she was trying to get Superman to do the whole time. Though since he's Superman he doesn't need the extra powers so her forgets about it. But every so often a super villain that's stronger than superman comes and he has to eat Lois Lane's butt to power up enough to beat them.\n\nIn comic book #486, Wonder Woman and Superman were in Space and this super powerful villain knocks Superman unconscious. But luckily Wonder Woman grabs Superman and escapes to a fortress. But the Super villain is closing in on them. Somehow Wonder Woman signals to earth and contacts Lois Lane, and Lois Lane hearing about the situation, pleads for Wonder Woman to take out Superman's tongue. After Wonder Woman does, Lois Lane then says 'Great, now pull down your blue underwear and sit on his face'. Wonder Woman is like 'wtf' and Lois Lane is like 'THERE'S NO TIME TO EXPLAIN'. So Wonder Woman does so, and her butthole induces the extra powers. He's still unconscious but when his tongue starts to stir Wonder Woman makes this face https://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/191/809/me_gusta_mucho_by_megustamuchoplz-d416uqk.png\n\n. She's had her ass eaten before, but none of those tongues could apply pressure like that super tongues .\n\nWhen SuperMan regains consciousness he's like 'wtf', and Wonder Woman was like 'Lois Lane told me'. But there's no time for that, the super villain is here, but SuperMan defeats him with his new powers. But this time it was too easy, even with butthole powers. It turns out that since it was Wonder Woman's butthole, his powers were Wonder Butthole augmented.\n\nA similar situation happened between Supergirl and Superman in comic book #531. And with Mera and Superman in comic book #589.\n\nIn Comic book #656 Mera, Supergirl, and Wonder Woman were hanging out and talking about sex, and the all find out that the best ass eating they ever has was from Superman, and because only his tongue could apply super pressure. But they only get to experience it when a super duper villain appears that's more powerful than superman. That's when they have an idea. The go to Brainiacs liar, and let them have their DNA to make a Supervillian. Brainiac asks why are they don't this, but they don't answer.\n\nThey create the Super villain and unleash him. Then Mera, Supergirl, and Wonder Woman all make their way to Superman, but they realized they didn't decide who gets their ass eaten. They then start fighting over whose entitled to it. Superman makes his way over and finds then all fighting. He's like 'please, I just need a meta-ass, any meta-ass'. The 3 girls then to let Superman decide. While Superman's thinking, Wonder Woman pulls down her sweaty n slimy blue underpants and spreads her cheeks and says 'yes, pick whatever you want' while winking her butthole at Superman.\n\nThis was a sneaky ploy on the part of Wonder Woman, with her fat, muscular cheeks and pretty butthole winking at Superman, she has an advantage. But then Superwoman and Mera do the same.\n\nSuperman see's the tension. He then uses his super speed to give all three of them simultaneous eats eatings. After he's done, he's ready to fight. But then Wonder Woman is like 'uh Superman?'. And points to his crotch. Since he's ate 3 meta asses, he gained 9x the powers, and the new suit he designed to constrain his Super boners during ass eating wasn't designed to handle the pressure of his 9x boner.\n\nHis superboner silenced everyone into an awkward silence. Superman thought he would wait for a few minutes for it to reside before going to the villian but the 3 woman's eyes were like invisible hands stroking his cock. and the strength, the pressure, of his erection quickly pulled it away from his waist. His cock then started to pull up, wanting to stand straight up rather than be forced down to the side.The girls watched transfixed as they saw the movement through his briefs. It was like it was alive, trying to escape to the tight confines, and soon the head of his beast appeared over the top, coming full into view. Their eyes widened at the sight. It was so bulbous, so red, so engorged. Once over the edge, past the elastic, the shaft quickly slid up straight, boldly climbing out and pushing down on the waistband.\"Wow,\" Mera said quietly, speaking for all them, as his naked, stiff cock was now jutting out from his body. It was indeed a very impressive demonstration of the force of his hard 9x cock.\n\nMeanwhile Brainiac is watching the whole thing from a satellite as is like 'wtf'.\n\nTo be continued in comic book #657",

Of *course* you're grateful you don't have a serious illness, but what does this have to do with music lessons?\n\nAn emotionally intelligent parent would sit you down and talk calmly with you, and explain why something is not possible, without going on a rant and calling you names (brat is a name no one should call anyone, except in jest).\n\nI hope that you can find a good therapist when you're old enough to live on your own. This is abusive behavior.\n\nETA:  Parents are supposed to build you up, not tear you down. They're supposed to be the ones always on your side, not being your enemies. This doesn't mean that they don't hold you accountable for your behavior, but it *does* mean that they should be responsive, and not abusive.",

Clean B&W UI, generally easy to pick up and understand. Quality.\n\nI've even picked it up after save corruptions and new devices losing my save data (though I'd take a break when that happened). It's a must try.\n\n-------------------\n\n# __Armory & Machine__    \nAlso, I've recently picked up and been immensely enjoying:\n\n[Armory & Machine](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1240379695)    \nIOS link\n\nI'm just about to prestige for the first time and thoroughly loved the first run through. A nice incremental about balancing production numbers and plateauing production, with a sprinkling of once or twice a day realtime ability selection combat. Think Pokemon or old FF but with cooldown timers.\n\nIt's a shame that the sequel development didn't go well and it was pulled from circulation but I'm content with the original game. \n\n-------------------\n\nThanks for reading my rambling.    \n**Fin**",

Finally, a woman came running over. I think she was a horse-drawn carriage operator. She came running and stood between me and the couple. She looked at me and loudly said, \"I saw everything. These people are full of crap and trying to scam you. He walked into your car and was barely bumped. I'll testify in court.\"\n\nI was all, omg, THANK YOU.\n\nAnd as soon as the couple heard that, the guy stopped faking his injury, got up, and the couple walked away like nothing happened. \n\nSome people are giant assholes.\n\nThat horse-drawn buggy operator was hella cool, though.",

He's already introverted as he is so our conversations were mainly 'how was school?', 'have you eaten yet?', etc. He doesn't have time to sit down and play games that require a lot of time to complete, and considering he doesn't know English it has limited the amount of games he can play (he's just a child in a man's body). We now have an excuse to go out for walks and there's always something to talk about between us. I don't think I'd still be playing as religiously as I do now if he were to quit. I am not quite as young as your daughter though, both my sister and I have just graduated from university to give you an idea of how old we are :) I'm actually going out later to help him complete the fifth anniversary collection while he's at work.

A few days later we added our first algorithmic scanning code and continued on.  Needless to say,  people have been saying \"AV is dead\" for various reasons over the past ~27 years and, well, we've been too busy protecting computers to notice.\n\nFor the past eleven years I've been at another company (ESET), and been fighting malware authors or gangs or groups or whatever you want to call them these days, so from that perspective,  it really doesn't seem that different--or that long ago--to me.\n\nOf course, the *nouns* have changed, that is, the types of threats and what they do, but the same can also be said of how we (the industry) respond to them.\n\nBona-fide classic computer viruses are on the decline, typically accounting for a single digit percentage of what's reported on a daily basis.  A classic computer virus, of course, being defined as a computer program that is recursively self-replicating and it and its children can make (possibly evolved) copies of themselves.  I'd also add that classic computer viruses are parasitic in nature, which makes them different from computer worms or Trojan horses or bots or any of the other things that fall under the generic umbrella of malware. \n\nMost malware seen on a daily basis is non-replicating in nature, and is installed on a system through a vulnerability in the OS or apps, poor security,  social engineering of the computer operator, etc.\n\n\"Anti-virus\" software has evolved over time, just as the threats have, in order to protect users, but it's stilled called *antivirus* software for marketing reasons, which I personally think should have changed a while ago, but that's a bit of a digression/side rant. \n\nToday, your anti-malware software has all sorts of non-signature technologies in it to cope with these new kinds of threats (heuristics, exploit detection, HIPS, application firewalls, prevalency, cloud-based, etc.) but we've (again, the industry *we*) have done a horrible job of communicating intelligently to our customers about this, which is why you keep seeing the whole \"AV is dead\" thing popping up over and over again like something that's, er, undead.\n\nOne of the best examples of this is is how so-called NGAV (\"next generation anti virus\") companies have positioned themselves against established security companies that have been around for years--or even decades--by saying \"AV is dead\".  Quite a few of the things the NGAVs promote are things the established companies have been doing, but we never just talked about them that much in public because we thought they were incomprehensible, were too complex for customers to understand, or, most often, were just another layer of technology we use to protect customers--an important part at times, but still only a component of a bigger system used to protect customers.\n\nI can't take any credit for it since it's from another security company (Kaspersky), but there's an article on their SecureList site called \"[Lost in Translation, or the Peculiarities of Cybersecurity Tests](https://securelist.com/blog/opinions/76696/lost-in-translation-or-the-peculiarities-of-cybersecurity-tests/)\" that actually analyzed tests done by independent third-party testers who performed the same tests, but against each group separately (NGAV programs were tested against each other, established programs were tested against each other, but the tests done against each group were the same), and, well, in many of those tests it appears the only thing \"next generation\" about some of those products is their marketing of the whole \"AV is dead\" bandwagon.\n\nOne thing I'll point you to is a paper explaining how ESET's non-signature technologies work, which is available for download [here](https://www.eset.com/int/about/technology/).  Before I get yelled at for shilling, I will point out that a lot of these technologies exist and are used by other companies.  The implementation details and resources put into each one are going to vary by company, but the point is there's a lot of things besides computer viruses and signature scanning that security companies are doing, even ones that have been around for a couple of decades.  **EDIT:**  [Here's a similar explanation from F-Secure](https://labsblog.f-secure.com/2016/07/08/whats-the-deal-with-detection-logic/).

            "Citizens, Not the State, Will Enforce New Abortion Law in Texas\nThe measure bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. And it effectively deputizes ordinary citizens to sue people involved in the process.\nAnti-abortion protesters stand near the gate of the Texas State Capitol after Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill outlawing abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected in May in Austin, Texas.\n  \n\n  \nBy Sabrina Tavernise\n  \nJuly 9, 2021\n  \nPeople across the country may soon be able to sue abortion clinics, doctors and anyone helping a woman get an abortion in Texas, under a new state law that contains a legal innovation with broad implications for the American court system.\n  \nThe provision passed the State Legislature this spring as part of a bill that bans abortion after a doctor detects a fetal heartbeat, usually at about six weeks of pregnancy. Many states have passed such bans, but the law in Texas is different.\n  \nOrdinarily, enforcement would be up to government officials, and if clinics wanted to challenge the law\u2019s constitutionality, they would sue those officials in making their case. But the law in Texas prohibits officials from enforcing it. Instead, it takes the opposite approach, effectively deputizing ordinary citizens \u2014 including from outside Texas \u2014 to sue clinics and others who violate the law. It awards them at least $10,000 per illegal abortion if they are successful.\n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s completely inverting the legal system,\u201d said Stephen Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cIt says the state is not going to be the one to enforce this law. Your neighbors are.\u201d\n  \nThe result is a law that is extremely difficult to challenge before it takes effect on Sept. 1 because it is hard to know whom to sue to block it, and lawyers for clinics are now wrestling with what to do about it. Six-week bans in other states have all been blocked as they make their way through the court system.\n  \nThe Texas Legislature began a special session on Thursday, with a conservative agenda taking aim at voting rights and other issues.\n  \nThe law comes as the right to an abortion and the laws governing it are in flux. Abortion opponents have scored major victories in state legislatures over the past decade, with restrictions whittling down access through much of the Midwest and South. The 2021 legislative season has set the record for the most abortion restrictions signed in a single year in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion statistics and supports abortion rights.\n  \nThe Supreme Court has shifted, too, with conservatives now making up a solid majority, and an abortion case before the court next term.\n  \n\nState Representative Shelby Slawson spoke in support of the fetal heartbeat bill at the Texas State Capitol in May. \n  \nCritics say the Texas law amounts to a kind of hack of the legal system. In an open letter this spring, more than 370 Texas lawyers, including Professor Vladeck, said a central flaw was its attempt to confer legal standing on abortion opponents who were not themselves injured. They called the law an \u201cunprecedented abuse of civil litigation,\u201d and said it could \u201chave a destabilizing impact on the state\u2019s legal infrastructure.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cIf the barista at Starbucks overhears you talking about your abortion, and it was performed after six weeks, that barista is authorized to sue the clinic where you obtained the abortion and to sue any other person who helped you, like the Uber driver who took you there,\u201d said Melissa Murray, a law professor at New York University.\n  \n\n  \nSome statutes have authorized private citizens to sue to enforce a law even if they themselves are not harmed, said Howard M. Wasserman, a law professor at Florida International University in Miami. What is different about Texas\u2019 law, he said, is that private enforcement is not in support of state enforcement; it is in lieu of it, a switch he said was not good for democracy.\n  \n\n  \nWhat is more, a Supreme Court ruling last month involving a credit reporting company rejected the concept of people suing when they were not concretely harmed. That case involved lawsuits in federal court, but Professor Wasserman said lawyers for the clinics would probably use it in their arguments in Texas.\n  \n\n  \nThe most common place for clinics to challenge abortion restrictions in Texas has been federal court, where they have won more often than at the state level. Supporters of the new law say it is an attempt to argue abortion cases in the courts of the state where they originated \u2014 Texas \u2014 without anti-abortion measures immediately being suspended by a federal judge, as often happens.\n  \n\n  \nJohn Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, the largest anti-abortion organization in the state, said that some people in the anti-abortion movement thought \u201cthis was not working in federal court, so let\u2019s try a different route.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nLawyers for the clinics argue that a six-week abortion ban is clearly unconstitutional, and that the Texas law is designed to insulate the state from a challenge. Federal protection currently extends to pregnancies up to the point at which a fetus can sustain life outside the womb, about 23 or 24 weeks. Given that federal courts are experienced at deciding constitutional rights issues, lawyers for clinics say, it is logical to go there for relief. The new law, if it takes effect, will make that much harder.\n  \n\n  \nThe clinics and their staff \u201care stuck in state court in a defensive posture, and there\u2019s a lot at stake,\u201d Professor Wasserman said. \u201cIf they lose, they are on the hook for significant sums of money.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nThe Texas law has energized abortion opponents. Mark Lee Dickson, director of Right to Life of East Texas, said he knew many people who were eager to sue abortion providers if the law took effect.\n  \n\n  \nPlanned Parenthood sued the city of Lubbock, Texas, over its new ordinance restricting abortion, but the judge threw the case out and the local clinic stopped providing abortions.\n  \n\n  \nLast year, he pushed for an ordinance in Lubbock, whose legal structure was similar. He said that more than 200 churches were part of that effort. Mr. Dickson travels to cities to help them pass such ordinances, and noted that there are almost 30 in the state that have done so. Lubbock was the only one with an abortion clinic, but the sentiment among people in those places could power a broader effort to enforce the state law, he said.\n  \n\n  \nHe said people wanted to sue as an expression of their deeply held belief that abortion is wrong. They saw the procedure as \u201cmurder of innocent children and they wanted to do everything they could to stop that,\u201d he said.\n  \n\n  \nLawyers for abortion clinics are deciding how to respond. Julie Murray, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said that if the law took effect, clinics and doctors could defend themselves against the citizens who sue and might prevail in individual cases. But what one judge does in one case is not binding on other cases, and she said there could be a flood of suits across Texas\u2019 254 counties.\n  \n\n  \nMr. Seago said he did not think there would be a flood of suits. State judges will still expect claimants to build a case, and identifying targets \u2014 a specific abortion that was performed later than the fetal heartbeat was detected \u2014 would not be easy, he said.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cThere\u2019s still quite a lot of hoops to jump through for a claimant to prevail,\u201d he said.\n  \n\n  \nBut even the threat of suits can cause a clinic to shut down abortion services. That is what happened in Lubbock. Planned Parenthood, which has a clinic there, sued the city after the ordinance passed in a voter initiative in May. But the judge threw out the case, saying the organization did not have standing to sue the city. The law went into effect June 1, and the clinic has stopped providing abortions. Last week, Planned Parenthood filed a motion to reconsider.\n  \n\n  \nAngela Martinez, manager of the Planned Parenthood health center in Lubbock, said she had to tell patients they would now have to drive five hours each way to Dallas for care.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult conversation,\u201d she said.\n  \n\n  \nSabrina Tavernise is a national correspondent covering demographics and is the lead writer for The Times on the Census. She started at The Times in 2000, spending her first 10 years as a foreign correspondent. \n  \n\n  \nA version of this article appears in print on July 10, 2021, Section A, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Texas Gives Citizens Authority To Enforce Its Law on Abortion.",

I actually remember watching a programme on TV as a teenager and there was a part about foot fetishism so that was probably the first time I was really aware of it.\n\n* Q: How did you first learn you had pretty feet?\nIve had odd compliments here and there and just brushed them off really. The first time I really thought about it was when I was selling some old bits from my wardrobe on ebay. I was approached by someone asking about my feet after seeing the shoes I had for sale. This made me curious about sharing them and seeing how well they go down in the foot fetish world\ud83d\ude0a\n\n* Q: What is your favorite song lately?\nI've been listening to Wayside by IG88 on repeat lately, just makes me feel really chilled and relaxed especially after a long day\ud83d\ude4cThe best is super loud with headphones zoning out on my bed\ud83d\ude0d\n\n* Q: What is a social media link you would like to share?\n-[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sweetsoles9/?hl=en)\n-[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSYl7yFRD4JVV_YocY1PHbg)\n\n* Q: What is your favourite book lately? \nI'm reading Two women by Martina Cole at the moment. She's one of my favourite authors, her books are gritty crime thrillers and they have me hooked. \n\n* Q: Which **r/VerifiedFeet post flair option is your favorite? \nTops and Soles\ud83d\ude0abecause its always nice to have both! Quite fun for different poses and mirrors too. \n\n* Q: Which Verified Foot Model do you want to give a shout out to? \nu/toe-rags because she has beautiful feet and her posts are always flawless\ud83d\ude0d\n\n* Q: What do you like about r/verifiedfeet? \nI love the frequent and consistent high quality posts from a variety of diverse models and being involved in such a positive community. \n\n* Q: What's a strange fact about you people wouldn't expect? \nI'm extremely talented in drinking competitions and once drank a whole yard in a competition and came first place\ud83d\ude4a\n\n* Q: Do you look at other women's feet and admire them? \nAbsolutely yes! I always notice womens feet, now more than ever! In the summer when everyone is wearing sandals I always appreciate and notice pretty feet and pedicures. \n\n* Q: What has being a foot model taught you about people who have foot fetishes? \nThat way more people than you might imagine are attracted to pretty feet for a start! I've learnt people with foot fetishes have an eye for detail and appreciate the finer details, I like that\ud83d\ude0a\n\n* Q: Why do you think men/women find feet attractive? \nI think women's feet are an extension of their femininity, they are very sensual in that respect. They are also hidden away a lot of the time so this makes it almost more exciting when we do see them\ud83d\ude4a\n\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe to r/VerifiedFeetGifs!"

            "These tools are designed to help customers differentiate between GENUINE products and counterfeit imitations. ONE of the most trustworthy ways to verify a product is to look for a hidden tag verification or QR codes. With smartphone apps you can scan these unique tags or QR codes on the product packaging. Your app will authenticate the  product by verifying the hidden tag's information. Counterfeit products are unlikely to have these  hidden tags or will fail the verification process.\n\n**1. HIDDEN TAG APP**\r  \nProducts using these Hidden Tags are the Caratfill DEEP, SUB-Q, KISS Fillers, Caratfill Skinbooster PN+HA, Lithe skin care solution, GANA CH Filler, GANA HA body Rejuran Skin Booster, Rejuran S, Rejuran True Skin and Rejuran HB.\r  \n\r  \nTo verify the authenticity of these products using the Hidden Tag App, follow these steps:\r  \n\r  \n1. Download the Hidden Tag app.\r  \n2. Open the app and navigate to the section where you can scan or input the unique QR code or hidden tag found on the product packaging.\r  \n3. Position your smartphone's camera over the QR code or hidden tag and allow the app to scan it. Alternatively, manually enter the code if asked.\r  \n4. The app will then authenticate the product and provide you with a verification result. It should confirm whether the product is genuine or potentially counterfeit.\r  \n\n\n**2. ICS CERTIFICATION APP**\r  \nNEO-CAIN 500G and J-CAIN 500G are using the ICS Certification App, which works similar to the Hidden Tag App.\r  \n\r  \n**3. COMPANY QR CODE**\r  \nFor products like Repair cream for face, BB Glow, Aqua Stem Cell Ampoule, Whitening Stem Cell Ampoule, AC Gold Ampoule, Aqua Stem Cell Ampoule, Aqua Shining Sun Block, Bellmona BIO Signal Eye Cream, Bellmona Holding Time Tox Cream, 1.st NEFER TI TI SOLUTION, 1st BLANJU Skin Boosters, Rejuner Black, Red, Gold , Wellsfill, Sedyfill 60cc Wizyox and Tox ta you will find a QR code on the box from the manufacturer.\r  \n\r  \nYou can Follow these steps to verify your product:\r  \n\r  \n1. FIRST, Locate the QR code on the product packaging.\r  \n2. SECOND, Scan the QR code using your smartphone's camera or a QR code scanning app.\r  \n3. THIRD, The QR code will redirect you to a website or landing page specified by the company.\r  \n4. AND LAST, The website or landing page should display verification information.\r  \n\n\n**4. SCRATCH QR CODES**\r  \nProducts like Kabelline, Touch UP, Touch BR, Beads Max Classic-H, Beads Max Classic-S, DBP Nanoneedle and DBP Nano Cannula have scratch QR codes.\r  \n\r  \nTo verify the authenticity of these products using scratch QR codes, follow these steps:\r  \n\r  \n1. Locate the scratch-off section on the product packaging.\r  \n2. Carefully scratch off the designated area to reveal the QR code.\r  \n3. Scan the QR code using your smartphone's camera or a QR code scanning app.\r  \n4. The QR code will redirect you to a website or landing page provided by the brand.\r  \n5. AND LASTLY, Follow the instructions on the website or landing page to verify the product's authenticity. This may involve entering the unique code revealed by scratching the QR code.\r By following these steps, you can use these apps, company QR codes, OR scratch QR codes to verify the authenticity of products. ALWAYS make sure you have downloaded official apps and refer to official websites from the manufacturers for verification.\r  \n\r  \n**For brands that don\u2019t use ANY of these verification processes, there are other ways to detect fake products.**\r  \n\r  \n**5. PACKAGING & PRINTING**\r  \nOne of the first signs of fake Korean products is a discrepancy in packaging and printing. Authentic products usually have high-quality packaging materials and precise printing with clear branding and product information. Counterfeit products may have blurry logos, misspelled words, or poor-quality packaging.\r  \n\r  \nHOWEVER, PLEASE also note that it\u2019s fairly common for Korean brands to have different packaging designs based on the country of export. A good example of this is J-Cain Numbing Cream which has multiple different product colors for the local Korean market and the international market. Other products that have multiple package designs are Dermaheal, Hyaron and Spider Aqua eye booster.\r  \n\r  \n\r**6. BATCH NUMBER AND EXPIRATION DATES**\r  \nAlways check the batch numbers and expiration dates on the product packaging. Genuine Korean products have accurate and properly printed batch numbers and expiration dates.\r Fake products may have incorrect or inconsistent information, including smudged or poorly printed details.\r \r  \n\r  \n**7. HOLOGRAPHIC STICKERS OR SEALS**\r  \nMany authentic Korean beauty products come with holographic stickers or seals as an ADDITIONAL security measure. These holograms are difficult to replicate and can help verify the authenticity of the product.\r Counterfeit products may lack or have poorly designed holographic stickers.\r  \n\r  \n**8. MFDS APPROVED PRODUCTS**\r  \nThe Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of the Republic of Korea (MFDS, formerly known as KFDA) is responsible for regulating and approving beauty and medical products in South Korea. Genuine Korean products are MFDS approved. PLEASE, note that only products can be MFDS approved, NOT vendors or retailers.\r  \n\r  \nTo summarize, it is important to pay attention to packaging, batch numbers, holographic stickers, KFDA approval, and hidden tags or QR codes. This way you can protect yourself from potentially harmful and ineffective counterfeit Korean products. Remember, investing in authentic products not only ensures your safety, but ALSO guarantees the desired results for your skincare and aesthetic needs.",

            "Your hypothesis is correct. Racism (as evil and stupid as it is) evolved for the same reasons why almost every other behavior evolved\u2014 it provides the organism with a greater ability to propagate its genes at the expense of the \u201cenemy\u201d or \u201coutsider\u201d. \n\nIn short, humans are not racist, their DNA is. It\u2019s their genes trying to outcompete the \u201coutsider\u201d\u2019s genes. It\u2019s all related to sexual reproduction. That\u2019s why men tend to be more racist and tribal than women ON AVERAGE. \n\nMen want to reduce the male competition for cheeks, while women on the other hand dont mind it at all (since more men from various \u201craces\u201d = more variety of good genes to choose from). \n\nThat\u2019s why racism (which is really just tribalism) evolved in every single society and region on earth. Even if you make all men black, they will still find ways to create subgroups (tribes) and new ways to differentiate themselves from the \u201cenemy\u201d, despite having the same skin color. \n\nPerfect example is the extreme racism/tribalism in subsaharan pre and post-colonial Africa among tribes who look almost identical, have common ancestors, but still find ways to discriminate based off BS like \u201coh they\u2019re from a different tribe or speak a different language or worship a different god\u201d or whatever. \n\nThe same can obviously be seen in the tribalistic wars of ancient Greece, the middle east, the Americas, Oceania, South and East Asia etc. even before the world was connected. Humans will find ways to be racist or prejudiced even if every singe person looks the same. They\u2019ll just look for new ways to create categories. Race or skin color is just one of the ways. \n\nAt the end of the day, DNA just wants to pass on as many copies of itself (including close relatives) as possible, and if other genes (other DNA) get in the way of that, racism or prejudice enters the chat as a way to reduce the competition and restrict resources to one\u2019s group only. Racism is just a branch of the tribalism (them vs us) oxytocin fueled tree. \n\nTL;DR: yes, racism is rooted in evolution. Even animals are \u201cracist\u201d. And no, that does not mean racism is good. I condemn it in every video. We evolved to take piles of stinking shit. Doesn\u2019t mean doodoo is good. Gotta put that out there before the retards pour in with the usual straw man arguments \u201cmiGaN sAyS rAciSm iS oK\u201d.",
            "Although many will try to virtue signal and say that you\u2019re shallow for thinking like this, i think there\u2019s nothing wrong with considering your wife\u2019s genetics when planning to have kids. In fact whether we wanna admit or not, we already do it subconsciously when we scan for mates. Throughout history, Humans have always used proxies of fertility and health when selecting sexual partners (example, women selecting resourceful and strong men, and men selecting fertile, healthy and low hip to waist ratio females etc) , so why stop now? Pick the best mother you can find for your future kids. They\u2019ll thank you for it lol",
            "Why chimps are so jacked:\n\n1) they don't eat \"low protein\". The average male chimp weighs about 120 pounds, and they eat around 125 grams of protein on average, sometimes more (in the wild, when they go hunt and kill smaller animals). so they actually eat around 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.\n\n2) chimps do \"Nucleus Overload\" pretty much. They're doing \"pullups\" pretty much all day long (a ton of high frequency \"weekly volume\" for biceps, back, rear delts, traps). also their upper body is significantly bigger than their lower body (compared to humans), so more mechanical tension on their legs as well when they walk/run.\n\n3) chimps (especially males) have **extremely** low body fat, so most of their mass is pure muscle\n\n4) 1-2% gene difference between humans and chimps seems small, but that's about 200-400 genes. That's a LOT.\n\n5) some male chimps (especially high ranking males) have astronomically high Free testosterone levels .\n\nI'll explain more in future videos",
            "I thought you were joking at first but it seems you're serious. No hate bro, but if you're referring to a fully grown male chimpanzee (and that's me being nice, because honestly even a female or adolescent chimp can do the job), and you have zero weapons, then you're 100% f\\*cked regardless of your training. Mainly for 2 reasons (there are far more):\n\n1) chimps can generate enough pulling and jumping force (in seconds) to dismember humans and other chimps. In short, as crazy as it sounds, a chimp can literally grab your arm and generate enough force to pull it completely off, and at the very least completely dislocate it in an instant.\n\n2) chimps have a bite force of over 1000-1200 psi. let that sink in for a moment. that's stronger than some lion bites. Humans have a bite force of only about 150-170 psi, yet that's enough to cause some serious damage if another grown ass man decides to bite into your skull, neck or limbs. Now imagine a chimp with nearly 10 times more bite force than this, biting into your head or limbs. \n\nSo not only chimps are stronger, faster, and more agile (harder for you to hit them even if it mattered), but they can also just say \"f\\*ck it\" and just bite the shit out of you with over 1000 pounds of force per square inch. And the best you can do even with years of training is simply throw punches or kicks, which the chimp can easily catch and bite into (or pull).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: also I can't believe you said \"maybe a gorilla\" lmao. Maybe? really bro? lol",

            "Since you ask, here is a couple of tips for CAS to make the sim look more complex than a barbie doll:\n\nWhen breasts are big they gravitate towards the ground, so the nipples need to be placed a bit lower. Also drag down the breast slider slightly - not in volume (necessarily), but in height.\n\nInstead of widening the hip; widen the thigh slider - the hip bone is not wider than the shoulders, and the outer most point on a human is not the hip, but the upper part of the outside leg, usually.\n\nWiden the calves, it takes strong legs to carry all that.\n\nRaise the fat level slider on her, to 75% perhaps; her thighs look like a young teenager's with no fat and no muscle. Legs need to be strong to carry all that upper body weight.\n\nRaise the muscle level a lot; it will make her look less meager in places, and fill out the body some.\n\nChoose a cheek that looks rounder, and less wide lips, as a result of being in between them.\n\nWiden the shoulders, they are too thin for an adult that size.\n\nWiden the arms, stomach and butt - these are the areas women first gain fat on usually. Widen the waist slider slighty, it's too narrow compared to the shoulders.\n\nGive her a more  voluminous mount of venus; the outside appearance of a vulva grows in fat with the rest of the body.\n\nThere are a couple of different chins that slides gradually towards the throat, use those instead. Turn the sim in profile and test all of them.\n\nLike others have said, skip that collarbone, it's so meager she looks older than her face. The lower part of the face is the first to show signs of age, usually.\n\nLook at some pictures of people to get inspiration. Good luck! :)",

He also took an umbrella with his kit as a means of identification because he had trouble remembering passwords and felt that anyone who saw him with it would think that \"only a bloody fool of an Englishman\" would carry an umbrella into battle.\n\n> During the battle, Digby wore his red beret instead of a helmet and waved his umbrella while walking about the defences despite heavy mortar fire. When the Germans started using tanks to cross the bridge, Digby led a bayonet charge against them wearing a bowler hat. He later disabled a German armoured car with his umbrella, incapacitating the driver by shoving the umbrella through the car's observational slit and poking the driver in the eye.\n\n> Digby then noticed the chaplain pinned down by enemy fire while trying to cross the street to get to injured soldiers. Digby got to him and said \"Don't worry about the bullets, I've got an umbrella\". He then escorted the chaplain across the street under his umbrella. When he returned to the front line, one of his fellow officers said about his umbrella that \"that thing won't do you any good\", to which Digby replied \"Oh my goodness Pat, but what if it rains?\"\n\nHe was later injured by shrapnel, captured, sent to a hospital, escaped out a window, obtained a bicycle and fake ID card from the Dutch Resistance, and gathered 150 escaped soldiers to head towards the front line.\n\n**TL:DR;** Trained his men to use bugle calls instead of radio, took out an armored car with an umbrella, was captured, escaped, and led 150 other escaped soldiers to the front line via bicycle.",

            "The medical investigation in Ireland found it wasn't just Savita - it was a bunch of women who also died in the 2nd trimester in similar circumstances because of being denied abortions.\n\n[Savita Halappanavar](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741), a dentist, in the 2nd Trimester, went in with complications in Ireland, asked for an abortion, and was told \"Because of our fetal heartbeat law - we cannot perform an abortion\" and that law killed her.\n\nYou might think that's an overstatement, but that was the same conclusion  that the final report by the overseeing agency . The Ireland and Directorate of Quality and Clinical Care, [\"Health Service Executive: Investigation of Incident 50278\"](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2013/06/savita-halappanavar-hse-report.pdf) which said **repeatedly** that\n\n* the law impeded the quality of care.\n\n* other mothers *died* under similar situations because of the \"fetal heartbeat\" law.\n\n* this kind of situation was \"inevitable\" because of how common it was for women in the 2nd trimester to have miscarriages.\n\n* if one was to save mothers and follow evidence-based medicine the main change needed to include changing the law because their evidence-based medical recommendations couldn't be implemented unless the fetal heartbeat law was changed.\n\nQuoting:\n\n> We strongly recommend and advise the clinical professional community, health and social care regulators and the Oireachtas to consider the law including any **necessary constitutional change** and related administrative, legal and clinical guidelines in relation to the management of **inevitable miscarriage in the early second trimester** of a pregnancy including with prolonged rupture of membranes and where the risk to the mother increases with time from the time that membranes are ruptured including the risk of infection and thereby reduce risk of harm up to and including death.\n\nand\n\n> We recognise that such [medical] guidelines must be consistent with applicable law and that **the [medical] guidance so urged may require legal change.**\n\nand\n\n> the patient and her husband were advised of Irish law in relation to this.  At interview the consultant stated \u201cUnder Irish law, if there\u2019s no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, our hands are tied so long as there\u2019s a fetal heart\u201d.  The consultant stated that if risk to the mother was to increase a termination would have been possible, but that it would be based on **actual** risk and not a **theoretical** risk of infection \u201cwe can\u2019t predict who is going to get an infection\u201d.\n\nand\n\n> The investigation team considers that the situation was complicated by the difficulty associated with the application of **the law in Ireland** relating to the termination of a pregnancy.  The investigation team is satisfied that concern about **the law**... **impacted on the exercise of clinical professional judgement.**\n\nThe report detailed that there was advanced care, preemptive antibiotics, advanced monitoring, but .... they just couldn't keep up with how rapidly an infection spreads and the mother is **killed** when in the 2nd trimester the fetus still has a heartbeat but septic and about to rupture. \n\nIt's like doctors saying they can't take care of an infected appendix until it bursts. Nobody who has an inkling of logic or reason forces people to wait until a appendix ruptures (and spreads poisons like wildfire) before they can remove it. That non-logical, non-evidence-based, non-scientific approach takes what would be a normal situation that can be dealt with calmly and turns it into a flaming dumpster fire of a situation.\n\nWhen you read the report and all the attempts that staff took to PREEMPTIVELY help with antibiotics made it clear that even that wasn't enough  ...  this woman was killed because of the law forced \"belief\" over scientifically-validated, evidence-based, best-clinical-care medicine practices.\n\n>  **our hands are tied so long as there\u2019s a fetal heart\u201d**\n\nYou might think this was an Anomaly in Ireland. Evidence shows this isn't the case.\n\nEach time there's a ban on abortion maternal mortality goes up. Mothers are MURDERED by these laws. You didn't like the 5 year old study that showed it. Too bad. Facts don't care about feelings. In [country](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310596) after country, [around the world](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0705-y), when abortion is legal, maternal morality (e.g. DEATH) goes down.\n\nIn 2013 they allowed SOME abortions and ONLY again if there was maternal risk. Maternal mortality continued unchanged. Then in 2018 in the [Irish abortion referendum: Ireland overturns abortion ban](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44256152) and for the first time, Maternal Mortality dropped to ZERO.

No other state saw a comparable increase.\n\nAcross the world time and time again when abortion is banned ... women are as murdered by these kind of laws as if they were told they couldn't have an operation on an appendix until it bursts. Death and disease for women and more orphans are the results of these blind beliefs overriding science and logic.\n\nThe correlation between women dying and these laws happens time and time again and is as clear as the correlation between the COVID-19 non-vaccinated and their deaths and the increase in deaths in society.\n\nHas evidence of increased harms convinced people to get vaccinated? Nope. They die because \"from everything they know\" it's better to sterilize themselves with horse dewormer.\n\nThe question is: Are we are going to use evidence-based medicine to inform public policy or have a faceless bureaucrat get between a competent, evidence-based medical team and their competent patient and have more cases like Savita's with the \"inevitable\" similar cases in the 2nd trimester?\n\nI don't have much hope for some because many of the same politicians arguing for laws against abortion and ignoring the evidence of maternal mortality are the same arguing against laws on masks and vaccines and ignoring the evidence of COVID mortality.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards - kind internet strangers!"

Aside from breaking our anti-spam, anti-CSAM, and safety tools, how will anyone ever be able to moderate mature content communities in the vacuum you intend to create?\n\nAdditionally, many other communities rely on similar bots to exclude users of mature content communities from communities which serve minors as they often present a real safety risk. What are communities that need these functions to do when you shut off our ability to see huge swaths of Reddit?",

How are mods of mature communities supposed to moderate cross-posts and links to content to and from elsewhere on the site when we cannot see those other communities? We just cross our fingers and hope those links aren't taking our users to scams, disturbing, and/or illegal content? How do we defend against brigading when we cannot see where it is coming from? How do we exclude doxxing gangs, paedophiles, and other dangerous users from our communities when we can't see where else they are posting?

As angry as Trump supporters are, they will turn on him on a dime if he shows any weakness, and he knows that.\n\nSo, they keep up their facade and put out this email to *prove* to their supporters that they are innocent.

Those that support Hamas do so because they think the damage caused to Israel is worth the Palestinians lives that are sacrificed. Whether its to kick off a global revolution or a global jihad, these people want blood and conflict, and they want to feel the exhilaration of watching Israel be attacked and possibly fall.\n\nIsrael's stance has been that that peace with the Palestinians is contingent upon an understanding with the larger Arab world. The status quo is untenable and going back to pre-2005 Gaza is not something people want, either. Israel wants stable relations with a government that conducts itself like a government and not a literal terrorist organization.\n\nIf Saudi Arabia can be a leader in establishing this new Gaza, and can offer normalization with Israel as part of a path towards peace, you can expect Israel to pay attention. It appears that the US is doing a great job at keeping heads cool and allowing these kinds of discussions to take place before lines any larger are crossed."

It's stupid, and yet game authors do it all the time in open worlds.\n\nMaking the player spend time working when there is no gameplay scenes or women to seduce at work is a time sink.  Just give him money, since we're all going to enable the console and give ourselves money, anyways.  Just skip the tedium.\n\nMake travel instantaneous in an open world.  If the player has to jump the MC through multiple pointless screen changes to get to the needed spot, they are going to quit playing.\n\nNo mini-games.  Everyone hates them.\n\nJust remember that open world games take more work, and are more difficult to bug fix because they are easier to break when you didn't anticipate the player making the MC do things out of the expected order.  MC stats (if used) may end up out of scope to advance a story part because the player moved one storyline along so far before starting another one.  So the opening scene or second scene for Girl D may not trigger because the MC's needed state to trigger could be too high.\n\nAnd the final point is... MAKE THE GAME YOU WOULD WANT TO PLAY!  If you want an open world, make an open world.  If you want more linear story, make it that way.",

As a pgy1 I was told to debride a wound with ZERO prior instruction. I had a general idea. It didn\u2019t go well. Unconnected to my interventions, the patient was on death\u2019s door for other reasons and she passed away soon after returning to her nursing home. I was relieved that no one had to learn that I had done her ankle no help with my efforts. I should have known more. It was a learning point. Another time an attending told me to get a patient discharged in the morning. She refused to leave. I suggested a cab. I had lived in Chicago, everyone took cabs then. When her son came at 4 pm he walked me right up against a wall yelling at me for suggesting a cab. That was something NOT DONE BY PEOPLE OF HER STATUS in the little city I had moved to for residency. I learned from each experience. Study and re-study. Learn and don\u2019t quit learning. All of life is a learning experience. There will be these few times which will stick with you as the hard ones, and others that will reward you with fantastic memories.

            "Well, they came and went, but the Sunfish (blue & white striped sail) remained, until at age 30 I found one to take on that journey. 36 years ago you couldn\u2019t turn on your phone to check the weather, and it was a beautiful summer day, with a massive disabled Russian trawler right smack on the course to Newport, dirtying up the view with 6-8 stories of dark steel and people yelling in Russian that I was too close. Like anyone was going to leap 80 feet to defect, but I invited them. Glad they didn\u2019t. We sailed on to Newport in what was one of those perfect breezes, 10-12 mph and steady, heeling wonderfully, leaning back to see the daggerboard cutting through the bay, tacked about in among the rich in Newport and turned back to Jamestown and the weather changed. The warm day started to spit on us, then outright rained, and winds pushed up to 15-20 I would guess. Chills ran through us. The mainsheet was trying to yank from my wet grip with every gust. What made it great fun was the wall of fog that rolled in as we were heading back on a beam reach flying towards Jamestown as fast as a Sunfish can plane. Suddenly we had no idea where we were headed, and had only the hope that the wind had not changed direction. We had on life vests and t-shirts and shorts/bathing suits. We took about 1/2 hour to end up finally seeing recognizable land just about 1/2 way between the launching point and Clingstone (House on the Rocks). From there it was a simple downwind journey to the town, maybe 1/2 mile. Ever-present in our minds with about 50 feet of visibility the whole way across was sailing right into that steel wall during the late years of the Cold War. I was very happy to have accidentally beat into the wind a little and ended up a bit south with a south wind to send us home. Once back on the trailer, I said something like, \u201cIf you stay with me, I can promise you\u2019ll never be bored. Scared to death, maybe, but never bored.\u201d My beautiful wife of almost 34 years \u2014it took 2 more to win over the trauma of her prior marriage\u2014is asleep beside me as I finger-type on my phone now.

            "Years ago, I WAS that strong manager.  *** long story, but worth the read ***\n\nTwo of my employees were hired as part time remote...two days in office, three days from home.  Both great employees, no performance issues whatsoever, and both had this written in their contracts.  They were basically administrative assistant level positions.  The other important thing to note is that their salary wouldn't support full time in office as they both had children...and their pay wouldn't support weekly daycare costs.  I didn't undercut their pay, I actually got them bumped up a bit from the approved salary as soon as I could because they were strong performers.\n\nA year later, a new VP came on board who didn't trust remote work, and he honestly didn't seem to like women either.  He told me, you need to get your staff, all of them, in the office every day.  I told him flat out, no.  I cited that the arrangement was in their contract, and that forcing them to do that would make these great employees quit as their salary didn't support that flexibility.  He said that wasn't his problem.  I said, well, if you force them to come in, I will quit.  I was confident in that answer as I was critical to the organization and had over 50 people spread across four strategically important teams reporting to me.\n\nNothing more was said about it...but then the games started.  He tried various ways to find grounds to fire me.  He couldn't.  Over this time, problem people were also transferred to work for me...and I quickly documented and had one removed...despite threatening to shoot me afterwards.  The police were on hand, so that wasn't a problem.  This reinforced that I was the one making reasonable decisions, and the VP was attempting to make irrational decisions...and if it happened now, he would be in HR on the grounds of discriminating against women...and them both being mothers with toddlers would add to that.\n\nWell, fast forward a couple of months.  I take the first vacation I have had in 3yrs...all with plenty of notice and pre-approval.  I get a call while on vacation that they have been monitoring another of the problem employees that others were afraid to confront, and they gathered enough info in one day to justify firing.  I authorized remotely, and I am to take him to HR on the day I return and then walk him out the door.  This guy was much more of a risk than the previous one as we all knew he had guns.  He was in the reserves and kept some in his car.  He also used steroids, and, in case you don't know, 'roid rage is real.  \n\nAnyway, first thing I do when I get back is make sure the Police are cued up to help me escort him out, and to make sure that he didn't come back.  Then I walk him to HR.  This was all self-inflicted on his part...he just wanted to fk off all day and not do any work...no matter how easy.  He was doing things on his work computer that he shouldn't be stupid enough to do...which I shouldnt have to spell out.  I had already given him at least 10 chances to shape up.  No luck.  He burned himself through his actions.  Leaving HR, he mutters that he will be back soon...and I know exactly what that means.  The police are around the corner and someone else has boxed up the little stuff he had at his desk and soon he is escorted out the door.  Another problem gone.  I'm lucky that he didn't come and find me later I guess, but maybe he heard about what happened next.\n\nAlmost as soon as I get back to my desk, I am paged to HR.  As soon as I get there, I know what's up, as the VP is sitting in a room with the head of HR with a folder in front of them.  He used these problem employees as an example of why I was a problem...despite them being hired by others and then transferred to me to deal with.  \n\nThey did not fire me.  They said that if I left gracefully, that it would be a resignation with a severance package - which they had already prepared - and all I had to do was sign...and, it was effective immediately.  I asked what they planned on doing about my in-office/remote workers - if this is what this was really about - and they said it's not my problem anymore...that they would be dealt with.  I should have called a lawyer or something, but things had become so tense that it was easier to just GTFO.  Mind you, I thought I was friends with all of HR...and, maybe they did keep me from being outright fired by this VP, but it was a shock.\n\nSo what happened to the two employees that Instood up for?  Well, one was forced to come in with no increase in pay to make up for the additional expenses she would have.  She eventually quit because it cost her money to work there, essentially.  \n\nThe other, well, she fkd me.  She was working with the VP this whole time with the hopes of taking my job...which was skipping at least three levels up the chain.  \n\nIn retrospect I realized that she even served as a distraction one day when the VP had IT put monitoring software on my computer.  She needed help picking up supplies for the office and asked if I could help.  As everybody else was insanely busy that day, it seemed reasonable.  That was a mistake.  I caught the VP and IT on camera as I was away.  \n\nAnyway, a week after my \"resignation,\" more than 25 of my employees chose to follow me out the door.  And who was handed my job?  Yep...the conniving woman who's job I did my best to protect.\n\nSo, would I do anything differently if given the chance?  I would absolutely still stand up for my people.  I would absolutely get rid of people when there is more than enough cause.  The only thing I would have done differently is to have been in touch with IT sooner than the VP...and had his computer monitored.  It could have saved the company a lot of money and headache, and likely my job as well as many others.  \n\nAfter a year, he was encouraged to work elsewhere (they couldn't fire him because of his golden ticket contract) after other boneheaded decisions like this, as well as costing the company millions of dollars...on top of triggering lawsuits from the company's business partners for breaches of contract.\n\nSo, yes, a strong manager will stand up for their staff...but sometimes it comes at significant cost.",
            "Documentation is key.  In this case HR backed you, but without the documentation, they would have done as they are mandated to do, protect the company and the bottom line.\n\nFolks, HR works for the company and their interests...not for you as the employee.

Don't think of HR as a safe space...ever.",

            "There is a lot to this, generally speaking there are several peptides you can use for weight loss. However are we talking about weight loss or body composition? Overall weight loss would be the much advertised **Semaglutide**, **Tirzepatinde** and the soon to come to market **Retatrutide.** Less well known peptides that work for weight loss are **AOD-9604, MOTs-C**...to name a couple. If you want more weight loss and body composition **Ipamorelin, CJC 1295, Semorelin, Tesamorelin, GHRP-6, GHRP-2**...all increase GH in the body and therefore help burn fat and build muscle (you need to do the gym work of course). For me I use CJC/Ipa (not a blend) regularly and cycle in Tesamorelin. The regular use of CJC/Ipa keeps me pretty lean and muscular. However, the Tesamorelin is the game changer. It works specifically on my \"visceral fat\" and helps build muscle. Visceral fat is the fat deep in your body and pushes the belly out and can cause all kinds of health issues. For me its hard to get rid of and pushes my belly out a bit. I have abs, if I keep on top of my viseral fat they actually look good...if I don't then I have a bit of a belly with abs on it...know what I mean? So what I do it cycle the CJC and Ipa with the Tesa back to back then take a break after a full cycle. It can be a lot of $ for peptides so I'll buy all in bulk from my source. I get them cheaper that way (I get a coupon code), and I have them ready to go as needed. I wont bore you with my exact protocol but welcome any questions you have. Hope that helps! \n\n#",

            "I have anxiety. **Vitamin D + K2** drops, **Magnesium** powder, and **Holy Basil** capsules are a huge part of keeping it under control. Vitamin D being the main game changer for me.  I also do a cycle of **Selank** every few months. That protocol starts with 300mcg daily and I titrate up for about two weeks. I find it levels me out so the other supplements work better...that make sense? I can elaborate if you would like. You will also find it in a nasal spray and injectable. I have used both and find the injectable works way better. Also, it's important to get your Selank from a local source, ideally US. You will find a lot of it comes from the eastern block...which I don't trust. I also don't trust Selank from China, I prefer to keep my mental health away from China (no Chinese peptides at all really). I have my go-to US peptide sources I trust so I stick with them. Lastly, PT141 and Cialis are should not be compared really, they are different...as in they do different things. PT141 will increase sex drive (acts on the central nervous system), and Cialis works by increasing blood flow to the penis. Clear?",

            "I live in Czech Republic and have been following this case for a few hours now. Most sources are in Czech, but foreign medias are picking it up too. I have to say that mass shootings like this are not common here, especially not at schools, but they happen from time to time. The police regularly train for them despite their rarity.\n\nThe shooting began after 3 pm today at the Faculty of Arts of the Charles University of Prague. The police and medics responded quickly. Some students and employees barricaded themselves in the building, some hid outside of the windows just like in the photo of this post. Some apparently fell. As of now, the police and the media respect their privacy and we don't know many details about the victims and survivors.\n\nThe shooter died two hours ago (likely by his own hand) and his identity is known to the police now. He was a student and likely had killed another person (his father) before the attack. As of now, his motive is not connected to any ongoing local or foreign events.\n\nTen people are dead (not counting the shooter) and there are around thirty injured people (some seriously, some lightly). The building is fully evacuated now. The cops are currently searching for potential explosives and other dangers now. Survivors have been receiving proper treatments based on their needs, be it hospitalisation or psychological help.\n\nNew information is being revealed gradually and all the time. We will likely know much more later today and in the following days. The public security will likely improve after this event.\n\nI wish well to all affected people and their families.\n\nETA: If you are currently in Prague, please stay safe and try to avoid the Jan Palach Square where the shooting took place. The cops are still operating in the area.\n\nETA2: 6:25 pm CET, over fifteen people reported dead.\n\nETA3: The first reports about the young man leaving for Prague, likely killing his father and talking about the wish to take his own life appeared shortly after the noon and they led to the evacuation of one university building where he was supposed to have a lecture. Unfortunately, he chose another building to strike later. The first reports about the shooting at the Palach Square came around 3 pm, the police arrived very quickly and the body of the shooter was found a little bit later. The police suspect the name of the shooter, who was inspired by an unspecified mass shooting event from abroad. The victims are being identified, their numbers are around fifteen as of now (7 pm CET), with almost thirty people injured. The police are still securing the area. There are some uncertain reports about explosives, but I don't think they have been confirmed, so don't take this as a fast (just yet?). The new and actualised reports are coming every few minutes.\n\nETA4: The reports about the armed woman in Prague who had supposedly helped the shooter are NOT confirmed. Nobody has been found and she might not even exist. Some also claim online that the people in the photo above are all shooters. This is NOT true. There was ONE shooter. These are people hiding from him.\n\nETA5: 8 pm CET now. Not much new is known. The police are still investigating everything. The shooter was a lone wolf. The police haven't officially confirmed his identity yet (because of his severe injuries), but the media have revealed who it likely was (including his online posts). The victims are being treated and their identities are keep a secret for now. Prague is secure now. No police officers were injured and no second shooter or other danger has been confirmed.\n\nETA6: 8:30 pm CET, the police released the footage of their (successful) attempts to divert the shooter's attention from more victims while he was on the roof. They apparently weren't able to target him right there, but they got him to turn at them. I don't recommend posting this footage on Reddit. The admins will likely take it down.\n\nETA7: 9 pm CET. More weapons were discovered at the attic of the university building. The shooter is now also a suspect in the murder of a father and a baby in the forest near Prague from the last week. The politicians are having an emergency meeting tonight. The police is going to officially release more information tomorrow at 11 am CET. The question of school security is being opened and there will likely be some changes to better protect students and staff.\n\nETA8: Almost 11 pm CET. The president and governmental officials have publicly spoken about what happened. Not many new findings at this point. Prague is secure, victims are being identified and survivors treated. More will be known tomorrow. Thank you for reading, I will leave this comment for now.\n\nThe victims are going to be officially remembered during the moment of silence at 12 pm (noon) on December 23rd.",

            "Hello, members of r/TerrifyingAsFuck and newcomers,\n\nThis is a very difficult post, but it's important that it was posted. People often don't realise what a suicidal person looks and acts like. Why? Because there is no particular way for them to act like. Some talk about death, some get withdrawn, some are suddenly happy... and some never reveal anything until it's too late. There might be no warning sights, but if you suspect that your loved one might be struggling with these dark thoughts, please consider reaching out to them.\n\nMany of you commenting here have some experience with this difficult topic. We as the mod team want to let you that we understand. Suicidal thoughts are very hard to deal with, especially on your own, and they deserve someone to hear them. If you struggle with these dark thoughts, please reach out. Don't bury them inside. Reach out to a trusted relative, friend or medical professional. They might be scared and even shocked at first, but they care about you and want to help. Regardless of what your mind is telling you now, you are an amazing person and deserve to be loved. Don't be afraid to reach out.\n\nIf you have no one to turn to, there are many resources out there for suicide that are able to help someone like you. Suicide most often happens in the moment, so if you need someone to talk to, please use one of the following resources:\n\n\\-  In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255. For other countries, please see this worldwide list of suicide hotlines: [https://www.suicidestop.com/call\\_a\\_hotline.html](https://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html) . ETA: Here is another good website for finding suicide hotlines in your country. It's regularly updated and directly works with many of these hotlines all over the world: [https://findahelpline.com](https://findahelpline.com) .\n\n\\- There are also subreddits with people suited to help you through your thoughts, like r/SuicideWatch, r/depression, or r/CPTSD. They have many resources listed as well.\n\nLoosing someone to suicide is very hard as well. Please remember that it's never your fault if your loved one decided to leave. They felt they had no other choice. Please stay strong and remember to take care of yourself. Talk to your loved ones and / or a therapist about your emotions. There are many resources for people like you as well, for example r/SuicideBereavement or [https://988lifeline.org/help-yourself/loss-survivors/](https://988lifeline.org/help-yourself/loss-survivors/) .\n\nAnd to everyone reading this: please know that suicide is never the answer. We know that it seems hard right now. Life can be extremely difficult sometimes, and it's hard to look at the future and see that things will get better. There are always other options, even if right now it doesn't look like it. Please don't be afraid to reach out and talk about your emotions and dark thoughts.\n\nAny comments invalidating suicidal people, mocking them, etc. will be dealt with very strictly.\n\nTake care, everyone. You are loved."

Police started a missing person enquiry, and she was found the following morning (29 April) at Hounslow train station.\n\n>Specialist officers worked with the girl and her family, gaining her trust, and she disclosed that she had arranged to meet a man on WhatsApp. The man had taken her to a hotel and had sex with her.\n\n>We commenced an intensive investigation to find the man responsible \u2013 who she only knew by the nickname \u201cDiddie\u201d.\n\n>By examining the content of her phone and looking at the background of a selfie she\u2019d taken early on the Monday morning, officers were able to identify the hotel where the offence took place. The suspect had paid cash, and booked in with an assumed name, but we were able to identify a suspect vehicle from the car park CCTV.\n\n>The car was added to a national \u201cwanted\u201d list on 30 April, and later that evening it was stopped and seized by the Met Police. The owner of the car, however, was not the man police were looking for and the investigation continued.\n\n>Officers continued to review CCTV from the area around the hotel, and further searches were carried out on different versions of the suspects \u201cassumed name\u201d. On 2 May the investigation team had another breakthrough \u2013 finding the key details that connected 34 year old Diiriye Ali-Jamac with the nickname \u201cDiddie\u201d.\n\n>On 2 May a \u201cwanted marker\u201d for Ali-Jamac was put on the Police National Computer and officers started visiting addresses associated with Ali-Jamac, to try and locate him, or someone who might know where he was.\n\n>The \u201cwanted marker\u201d led to a hit almost immediately with information that he had boarded a flight at Heathrow airport. Colleagues from the Met Police detained him on the plane at 19.15 on 2 May (less than 3 hours after the marker had been placed, and less than 30 minutes before the plane was due to take off) and he was bought back to Staines Police Station for questioning. Ali-Jamac was subsequently charged and remanded in custody.\n\n>It transpired that Ali-Jamac had purchased a one-way ticket to Ethiopia the day before. Interrogation of his mobile phone showed that he had received a text message on the morning of 1 May from the owner of the car he used to drive the victim to the hotel, telling him that the vehicle had been stopped and seized by police in relation to an allegation of sexual assault.\n\n>On Monday 19 August Ali-Jamac was jailed for six years after earlier pleading guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child. He was also given an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order.\n\n>Detective Constable Sally Michail from North Surrey\u2019s Child Exploitation and Missing Unit, said:\n\n>\u201cI would like to commend the victim for her bravery in speaking out against Ali-Jamac and having to re-live the horrendous ordeal she had suffered at his hands all over again when she provided her statement.\n\n>\u201cShe was completely taken in by this man, who was 20 years her senior and someone she thought she could trust. As soon as he became aware that police were on his trail, he tried to leave the country but fortunately we intercepted him as he boarded his flight.\n\n>\u201cI would like to thank the team who worked on this investigation for the sensitive and professional way they dealt with the victim to gain her trust so that she felt supported in giving her evidence, and for their relentless pursuit of Ali-Jamac, with officers working a 28 hour shift, including trawling through CCTV footage from the hotel, to ensure that he was identified as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n>DC Michail added: \u201cI would continue to encourage anyone who has been the victim of similar offences to come forward and report it to us straightaway. You will always be taken seriously and support and guidance will be provided to you by our team of specially trained officers.\u201d",

They offered a Wrangler and I figured it would be fun. Lot was empty so I spend a little bit driving over the curbs in their lot and they come running out like madmen telling me to stop. It's a Jeep and yet it can't drive over small bumps? What a fucking joke. So apparently its not offload capable if it can't handle curbs at like 20mph.\n\nSo get on the road and head to hotel. Half way there I decide to open the sunroof which is super hard with like 6 latches, and the fucking thing flies off. There's no hinges or anything on the sunroof, it's just a big piece of plastic that's completely unsecured. Luckily it was a 30mph road so there was just scrapes on it.\n\nAfter that - and for EVERY. FUCKING. DAY. Every jeep I passed would wave me down or just wave like they fucking knew me. The first few times I stopped and pulled over, but they never turned around or anything. Just randomly waving at other jeeps like jackasses. Like who the fuck were these people?\n\nI also tried out the 4 wheel drive and the thing went soooooooooo slow. The engine was running at the fastest it would go and I was only going like 20MPH. Ridiculous. Didn't even get to drive it in 4 wheel on the dirt, after only 5 miles the whole thing started shaking and I had to turn around. Maybe 4 wheel drive is more fun in the dirt but it's god awful slow on pavement.",

To become NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) certified, you only have to show that you can create reproducible, verifiable results.

            "I use to think astral projection was difficult until I stumbled across this method. It\u2019s not a lot of effort. You don\u2019t need to spend time cycling techniques. It\u2019s much simpler than that. Once you train your body to do these simple steps leaving your body is effortless. When you first wake up, before you move or open your eyes, you are teetering on the boarder of the physical and the astral. Your intention determines the outcome. Upon waking do not focus on the physical whatsoever. Do Not tune in to the sound of a car horn or the feeling of your sheets, because if you use your external senses you will have chosen the physical. You must train yourself to sit up instantly upon waking with the intention of entering the astral. Intention determines the the realm you experience. Once you train your body to sit up as a reflex to waking, entering the astral takes a fraction of a second. There is no trying, you simply do. Here are the [full instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShiftYourReality/comments/zsvcs4/intention_is_key_astral_projection_guide/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).",
            "**Tips & Tricks**\n\n**IMPORTANT** \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Learn the Method in two parts:**\n\nThe method is learned in two parts. **The first part** is to become aware of several awakenings and not move or open your eyes. This is training the subconscious to take your instructions. Although you don't move to the second part until the subconscious consistently takes your instructions, the number one way to set intention is to practice the swift exit motion in your mind before sleep.\n\nPracticing the exit motion helps your subconscious understand your goal. This not only sets intention, it also tricks your subconscious to believe it's already done it. So, by the time you move to step two your subconscious is convinced it knows how to AP because you've done the exit so many times in imagination.\n\nThe key to success is practice. We all wake up approximately every 1.5 hours. The more awakenings you become aware of the more practice you get. Once your subconscious consistently takes your instructions you move to **the second part**, which is to roll over onto your back into the trigger position to prepare for exit upon your next awakening. Now your subconscious takes your instructions with precision, so each time you wake-up on your back your subconscious knows to sit up like a reflex with the intention of entering the astral. This allows for multiple exits a day. \n\n**These are all factors that can affect awakenings and/or depth of sleep.**\n\n1. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeffDid you practice the swift exit motion in your mind before bed? There's no visualization, you need to feel it as if it's real.\n2. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeffHow long are you focusing on AP before you fall asleep?\n3. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeffDo you watch tv or movies in the evening?\n4. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeffDo you have a lot of recreational screen time?\n5. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeffDo you use alcohol or cannabis?\n\nThe last 1-2 hours before sleep deeply impresses on the subconscious. You should make AP a priority. When I learned astral projection I drenched my subconscious with everything AP. I literally stayed some weekends in bed determined to master it and I did. If shifting is really dear to your heart I would focus a lot more attention on AP. Cut out tv and cut down on screen time and make AP your primary focus because you can learn it quick.\n\n\u00a0\n**How do I Correct Vision Impairment?**\n\n\nAs soon as you get away from your body your vision will automatically correct itself. You can also use commands such as \u201cVision Now\u201d or \u201cClarity Now\u201d.\n\n\n**How to Stabilize Your Projection**\n\n\u00a0\nBefore you go to sleep plan tasks that will keep you alert for two full minutes after you enter the astral. Once you achieve the two-minute mark you will have a much greater chance to stay out of your body for a lengthy duration and have greater control over your experience. \n\n\u00a0\n**Examples of Tasks**\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022 Go to a mirror to see how you look.\n\n\u2022 Put out a playing card the night before and check to see what the suit is while out of body.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 See if you can get your pet\u2019s attention. \n\n**Grounding Yourself**\n\nGrounding yourself can help with mobility issues as well as help you stay out of body longer. Touch whatever you can.  Feel the walls, look for different textures and examine them by touching. You can also go to your fridge and taste something. \n\n\n**How to get where I want to go?**\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022 Fly\n\n\u00a0\nStart flying in the direction you want to go and your intention will guide you.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 Portal \n\n\u00a0\nCreate a portal using your bedroom door. Set an intention what is beyond the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022 Teleportation from within (Personal fav)\n\n\u00a0\nClose your eyes and concentrate on the location you want to be. Use all of your senses. You will know you teleported before you even open your eyes. - If you have aphantasia use imagination and feeling. \n\n\u00a0\n**Ensuring the Best Experience**\n\n\u00a0\nExit your body only when your frequency is normal to high. If you\u2019re going through personal troubles or had a bad dream save travels for another day. This will ensure the best experience. The astral will match your thoughts and frequency beyond your wildest imagination. We shift to an experience equivalent to our thoughts and frequency. Always expect only the very best.\u00a0\n\n\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\n\n\n**What is the quality of consciousness when you AP? Is it foggy or dream-like?**\n\n\nInterestingly I am much more aware and clear minded in the astral. I no longer have the monkey mind.  I can think rationally and concentrate with great clarity. \n\n**Why haven\u2019t you mentioned sleep paralysis or the vibrational state?**\n\n\u00a0\nThis method allows you to skip sleep paralysis and the vibrational state and move straight to the exit. You exit your body before you realize your body is paralyzed.\u00a0\n\n\n**What happens to our physical body when we astral project?**\n\nWhen we astral project our consciousness leaves our body and our body is left in a sleep-like state. We are always connected to our body when we AP. If there is something important needing your attention your soul/ essence/consciousness/awareness will return to keep you safe.\n\n\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\n\n**[How to Shift Realities](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShiftYourReality/s/vmMbnwj1nW) from Astral Projection.** \ud83c\udf08\u2728\ud83d\udc9d\n\n\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\n\nRemember to check out additional community resources r/ShiftYourReality\n\n\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\u2022.\u2022:\n\nPLEASE REPORT BACK TO SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCES!!",
            "Yes, it is possible. You should check it out for yourself. The method I use is very simple. The key is doing it at the right time. When you first wake up, before you move or open your eyes, you are teetering on the border of the physical and the astral. Your intention determines the outcome. Upon waking do not focus on the physical whatsoever. Do Not tune in to the sound of a car horn or the feeling of your sheets, because if you use your external senses, you will have chosen the physical.

Like if you are wearing hot eye makeup and long lashes, long blinks and closing your eyes while moaning is usually cum triggering. Going slow at first, then diving in like a total whore. \n\nFigure out what turns you on, then do it!\n\nSmell his balls. Lick his balls. Fondle his balls. Tell him you love his sack and suck it into your mouth. Balls are amazing.\n\nGo slow and really explore. Get close and look at that amazing cock. Feel it all over. Lick here and kiss there to see how he likes it. Smell it. Look up at him every so often to see his expression. Let it turn you on. Touch yourself if you want to. Tell him how much you love his dick.\n\nIf he starts to face fuck you, and you feel like you can't take the gagging anymore, spit on his dick, then wrap a hand or two around the base of his rod and stroke him while you kiss, lick and suck the top half of his cock. Your hands can be adjusted to prevent the deep strokes that hit your gag reflex. He can thrust away and it should still feel good because your hands are working all the right areas. Keep his cock wet and slippery if you do this, to keep irritation down.\n\nIf you want him to cum for you, in your mouth, on your face, whatever, say so. Talk dirty about it. You can say it a few times and encourage him to do what you want. It will help him to know it's okay to blow a load on you. Sometimes just asking will trigger him to cum on you, so you can bring it up after you've had a good time sucking and are ready for cum.\n\nI kinda wished I had taken a selfie/video my first time, hahaha. If you trust him, put your phone camera in photo mode while it's locked (if it does that), and let him take some pics and video. \n\nIt's also okay to just focus on the moment and get pics some other day.\n\n\ud83d\udc8b",

Buy something for yourself that you feel is missing from your Sissy kit. Dress as often as you can. You get home, right to girly wear. Being pretty more often is your punishment.  \n\n\nThen take some pics. Whatever feels safe, but exciting, crop and pick some you will post. Include how it makes you feel to be so girly, and what you need so badly right now. If that includes a spanking, or just someone to make you feel mindless and hot, or whatever, say so.

            "I think it is helpful to keep the following things in mind:\n\n\\- Change isn't always perceivable. A lot of TRE is actually working under the radar. Everytime the body tremors there is a release whether you notice it or not.\n\n\\- Experiment. If you observe no change with 5 min daily, try to do more. For example: First a week of 10 min daily, does it feel good? Stay there. Do you notice no change? Increase to 15 min daily, etc. Increase slowly and observe what the increase does. Stay at the time that doesn't cause side effects or only a little. That is your optimal daily practice time at this moment.\n\n\\- Did the intensity or location or frequency of the tremors change? Yes? Then you know that there is change! Even if it stays more or less the same for a while, it is still working (see point 1).\n\n\\- Trust the body. You don't tremor, the body does. You don't decide what needs to tremor, the body does. You don't decide when you are free of the pain and fatigue, the body does. It takes however long it takes. Surrender to the beautiful wisdom of the body.\n\nMotivation? You have to know deep inside that this is the way to become free of trauma and thus free of fatigue and chronic pain. What is the alternative? There is none. Not a good one anyway. TRE is an inherent natural mechanisme in mammals that is millions of years old and adapted by evolution. It is genetically encoded and is not made up by mankind. Thus no biases. It is the body healing itself, it knows what to do. Again trust the body and let the body do it's thing, no motivation needed, just give space for the body to express itself.",

If that baby was on her back alone in a safe space like a crib or pack and play, she would be alive. They also say how babies shouldn\u2019t be put sleeping together for this reason as well. One moves and the other falls/accidentally rolls over. \n\nApprox an hour seems interesting too as she had already turned blue and lifeless. The fact that it took Mac three calls and a person to tell him to call 911 means he already knew she was gone and was trying to figure out what to do. Annika deserved better.",

            "Bard said......\n\nIt's not a dumb question at all! Choosing where to download apps can be confusing, and it's great that you're thinking about it. Here's a breakdown of the differences between Play Store, F-Droid, and GitHub:\n\n**Play Store:**\n\n* **Official app store for Android devices.** Most popular apps are available here.\n* **Focus on ease of use and convenience.** Apps are curated and pre-installed on many devices.\n* **Privacy concerns:** Google collects data about app usage and may share it with third parties. In-app purchases and ads can also raise privacy issues.\n\n**F-Droid:**\n\n* **Free and open-source software (FOSS) app repository.** Apps prioritize privacy and ethical development.\n* **Less mainstream apps:** You might not find the latest popular apps here, but you'll discover unique and privacy-focused alternatives.\n* **Requires some technical knowledge:** Downloading and installing apps can be less straightforward than on the Play Store.\n\n**GitHub:**\n\n* **Software development platform, not specifically for apps.** Developers can host their code here, including app source code.\n* **Requires technical expertise:** Downloading and building apps from GitHub requires programming knowledge.\n* **Variety of apps:** You can find anything from open-source versions of popular apps to experimental projects.\n\n**Privacy:**\n\n* **Play Store:** Generally less privacy-focused, with data collection and ads.\n* **F-Droid:** Prioritizes privacy, with apps typically free from trackers and ads.\n* **GitHub:** Varies depending on the individual app. Some apps might be privacy-focused, while others might not.\n\n**Beyond privacy:**\n\n* **Play Store:** Offers a wider range of apps, including mainstream and popular choices.\n* **F-Droid:** Supports ethical development and open-source software.\n* **GitHub:** Provides access to cutting-edge and experimental projects.\n\nUltimately, the best choice for you depends on your individual needs and priorities. If you value convenience and a wide selection of apps, the Play Store might be a good fit. If you prioritize privacy and ethical development, F-Droid is a great option. And if you're interested in exploring open-source projects and cutting-edge apps, GitHub might be worth checking out.\n\nRemember, there's no right or wrong answer, and you can always combine these sources to find the apps that best suit you!\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
            "**Hold your horses, pixel-pal!  Don't toss your Pixel 8 Pro just yet! **\n\nSure, the battery drains faster than a toddler's juice box at a rock concert,  and the signal drops more often than your aunt's wifi on Thanksgiving.  But before you toss it like a hot potato, let's see if we can turn those frowns upside down! \n\n**Battery Blues? **\n\n* **Optimize that battery like a ninja!**  Deep dive into settings, hunt down battery-guzzling apps like runaway gremlins, and turn on battery saver like a boss.  You'll be saving juice like a squirrel preparing for winter! \ufe0f\n* **Updates to the rescue!** Google's got wizards working around the clock to fix those battery woes. \u2728 One update and your Pixel might just become a marathon runner, leaving the S23 Ultra in the dust (well, not literally, that's bad for the environment). \n* **5G? Nah, fam.** Sometimes, sticking to LTE in patchy areas is like switching to decaf coffee \u2013 not as exciting, but it keeps you going longer. \n\n**Signal Shenanigans? **\n\n* **Network reset, the magic button!** It's like rebooting your brain after a night of bad pizza. Hit that button, and your signal might just straighten up and fly right. \n* **Carrier calling? SOS!** Sometimes, your carrier's got the signal strength of a shy whisper. Give them a shout, maybe they've got signal-boosting superpowers you don't know about. \u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n* **SIM swap shuffle!** That little plastic card might be the culprit. Pop in a new one, and poof! Your signal might be back to belting out karaoke like it never left.\n\n**But wait, there's more! \u2728**\n\n* **Camera that's a masterpiece!** Remember that drool-worthy photo you took of your cat wearing a sombrero? The Pixel's camera is like a magic wand for your memories. \n* **Android like it's supposed to be!** No bloatware, no funky skins, just pure, unadulterated Android goodness. It's like a breath of fresh air after being stuck in a perfume factory. \n* **Google besties forever!** Assistant, Photos, Docs \u2013 they're all there, playing together in your Pixel playground. It's like having a Google party in your pocket! \n\n**So, before you say sayonara to your Pixel, think twice!  It might just need a little TLC and some fun troubleshooting adventures to get back to its shining self. And hey, who knows, maybe the next update will turn it into a battery-sipping, signal-slinging superhero! \u200d\u2640\ufe0f**\n\nRemember, life's too short for boring phones.  Give your Pixel another chance, and you might just find yourselves laughing (and taking amazing photos) together again!",

May I ask what I should post before I leave my community name u underneath??? Like how to go about what to post on them 2 community\u2019s to advertise my group??If you know what I mean. I\u2019m not great at explaining",
            "Thank you I just wish I could change my community name- I scoured the internet but unfortunately it\u2019s not possibly and I would have loved to change this to something more specific. I\u2019m going to put everything into this and if it doesn\u2019t work out il actually try to make plan a better one and think it through more thoroughly and create another. I\u2019m unsure how to jazz my page up even tho I have looked into how I\u2019m still stuck but il try again- thanks for your advice I appreciate it very much",
            "Hey I love this question it\u2019s a very interesting one!! And I\u2019d like to share what it means to me- raising a child right to me means bringing your child up to always be respectful to others, to teach them manners towards others and family- please and thank you, not to be rude. \n\nIn my eyes it also means to bring them up to be as confident as they can and to never let others harsh words or actions bring you down and to keep there heads high but at the same time to always make sure that they are honest and open with family.. \n\nnever to struggle with something on there mind or any problems they face. To be open to us as parents no matter if it\u2019s big or small and never keep things inside. \n\nAlways treat others how you would like to be treated, to have kindness in their heart never to be discouraged and change this no matter what others say and always offer help to others that may struggle or feel sad. \n\nIt\u2019s very important to teach your child/children that violence is unacceptable and not okay. At the same time that it is not okay to be a victim to violence or allow anyone to put hands on you. Explain how to go about what to do. \n\nHang on in there I only a have couple more things lol\n\nOne more thing that is important to teach your child/children is how to be safe outside, online and in school. \n\nTeach them what to do in certain situations that they may face- for example what to do if a stranger goes up to them claiming they are a friend of your parents and to go with them. I taught my daughter who is now 6 that if ever she faced this situation to NEVER go with this person if she doesn\u2019t know them.. even if she did always run to another adult and tell them and to contact us (I taught her our address) a police officer, teacher, someone of authority or a crowd of people. \n\nSafety is very important. If she is in a situation and feels that\u2019s it\u2019s not right or doubting about something she should get out of that situation and not do anything anyone tells her if she feels it\u2019s wrong.\n\nSorry this is sooooo long winded but it\u2019s important to raise them properly and I may have missed loads but these are what came to mind. \n\nMy final thing is that always give your child/children positive comments, now and again tell them you are proud of them, bring them up as they need a reminder now and again. Praise them when they make right decisions, praise them when they do well at school, praise them for good things they do. Always remember that some times they man get stressed like us adults and may act out now and again through tiredness and long days at school- we go through this too. At the same time make sure there is also a line.  Ready to correct them when they cross that line as disapline (can\u2019t spell) when it\u2019s appropriate as all children will try to push things.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear other people\u2019s answers on this question too!!! What are your thoughts Lucy?? What do you think raising your child right means to you??? Xx",
            "Wow that\u2019s so helpful thanks for that! Il check the guide out now as I want to put everything into this as I really want this group to be a success! Make it different to the other groups. Please if u ever have 5 minutes possibly shoot me some ideas what I could introduce into it! Thanks again for the help",

            "I don't think your comment will get downvotes, as the majority of users here are test takers. Mine might get downvotes, but facts need to be said. IELTS is secretive about many things, which doesn't sit well with test takers. As a result, many speculate and inaccurate assumptions  are spread. For example, NO IELTS examiner is instructed to deliberately lower the score to keep people taking the test. IDP and BC cannot do this because it's illegal.\n\nThe reason why such an assumption is all over the internet is a) Incompetent teachers cannot help their students get above 6.5, so they blame it on BC and IDP. b) Most test takers do not understand the band descriptors well, so they make mistakes that drag them down. In addition to your writing skills, you also need to follow the exam rules when it comes to standardized tests like IELTS. I have had nemourous native speakers as students. They wrote beautifully, but they made errors that dragged their scores down to 6.5. After reading the reports, they would see all those, work on them and then get to their desired scores.\n\nAnyway, examiners are under tight control to rate accurately by following the band descriptors. BC and IDP take this seriously, as all the examiners should rate scripts exactly the same way, but some examiners sometimes rate inaccurately, and that's why EOR and refund exist. If it's the examiner's fault, you'll get you money back and get higher score. I agree, there are flaws in the system like IOL being unfair and all, but facts are facts. Sorry to burst your bubble.",
            "You should know that this is a scam! Even if they have got their hands on the questions somehow, which I doubt, IELTS will eventually find out and ban you from testing for the rest of your life. Guys, don't risk your future. There is no easy way out! You need to study and prepare. We have banned those guys from this subreddit already. This is why they only message you. They can't post.",
            "So sorry to hear that, but sadly people don't realize the majority of EOR cases come back negative, and most people won't share bad news online. People with good news are more likely to share.",
            "Amazing score, weird parents ;)\n\nKidding of course, but congratulations!",

            "Don Elkins himself said that the information in the Ra material is pretty heavy. To understand how it all came about he recommends reading his first book, [Secrets of the UFO](https://llresearch.org/library/secrets_of_the_ufo_pdf/secrets_of_the_ufo_pdf.aspx), which is what I did about halfway through the second book of the law of one. Secrets of the UFO explains who Don is and how he got into UFOs. He often refers to his friend, Andrijah Puharich M.D., who was a doctor, researcher, author, and Inventor.  Dr. Puharich wrote a book about Uri Geller and the year and a half he spent with him in the early 70s before he gained world fame. That ends up being a UFO book. I highly suggest reading that as well.\n\nI learned about The Law of One researching the Secret Space Program. When Don asked about an abduction, Ra claims that the abduction was done first by the Orion group, and then again by our military. Don is dumbfounded by this revelation.\n\nBook 5 was released about 10 years later and is comprised of stuff that they left out because they did not want to be grouped in with the conspiracy theorist. It is also comprised of utilitarian stuff about how to keep Carla healthy so the channel can continue. In book 5, The larger conversation of our military secret space program and abducting our own is excellent. It\u2019s pretty funny too because Don\u2018s jaw drops to the floor and he is completely caught off guard by this revelation. He asked, at that time, how many people were in the secret space program and I think the answer was several thousand. Don asked how many craft that our military have of their own? Ra\u2019s answer was several hundred. But Ra claimed they are unmanned and have been militarized with weapons.  I\u2019d like to also note that Richard Doty (disinformation man) confirms that our military does abductions.\n\nAnother interesting sidenote is when Don asks about UFOs shutting down nuclear warheads. The answer is what humans don\u2019t understand is when Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs were exploded, it not only vaporized the people directly under them, but it also terribly screws up their souls/consciousness. Ra claims that even at the time of the channel in the 80s, they were still helping to repair the souls who died.  \n\nOne thing that I have learned in researching the secret space program and UFOs, is everything always comes back to consciousness. I suggest everybody take a look at David Bohm\u2018s work on his implicate universe theory of everything which basically marries our physical universe with the quantum universe and our consciousness being a quantum fluid dynamic.  \n\nIn the secret space program they talk about moving consciousness from one body to another. In the abduction phenomenon, and I will refer to the book, Masquerade of Angels, the person abducted speaks about seeing the ET\u2019s moving a person\u2019s consciousness or soul from one body to another. \n\nIt is definitely crazy and is certainly something to think about and place in your grey box of \u201cwhat if\u2018s?\u201d\n\n(Edit: Removed \u201cspace\u201d from spaceships when Don asked how many we have.\nEdit 2: changed ships to craft.)",
            "The idea of a star seed, and anyone correct me, is that all beings that exist in a higher vibration, typically the one your astral body travels in, can incarnate on this or any other planet to continue the learning process to raise their vibration.  So, you will hear \"star seeds\" say they are Anunnaki, or reptillian, or pleidian.  The mission is typically to raise our vibration and consciousness here on earth to help us transition to the 4th density. We are currently living in the 3rd but on the long slow transition to 4th.\n\nWith the stuff I've read and watched, it's possible beings could leave their planet without permission, hitch a ride, to come here to learn and teach.\n\nOften when there is contact, the message is to mediate to continue contact.\n\nAlso check out [llresearch.org](https://llresearch.org) and check out the library.  There is a book for [wanderers or star seeds](https://llresearch.org/library/a_wanderers_handbook_pdf/a_wanderers_handbook_pdf.aspx), if you really believe this stuff could be true.

            "Okay first and foremost a shameless plug for /r/beekeepers a nice little subreddit that is a great place to get information about bees. \n\nNow where is my soapbox?\n\nHere we go.\n\nrant begins here.\n\nI have been a beekeeper for eight years. I own a bee removal service that does humane removals (we don't kill bees). I have 4 employees. I have insurance, gas, and lots of equipment. [As another beekeeper posted in AMA that he is not removing your bees for free](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hhcuy/by_request_ama_i_am_the_beekeeper_whos_not_paying/). Neither am I. \n\nSome points on the video:\n\n1) I doubt the bees had been there for 10 years. They had more likely been there for about 2-3 years. \n\nBees will abandon comb as it gets older. it turns a redish brown color and has the texture of potato chips. Now if the bees are limited in space they may chew the older comb away but from the appearance with in the video that is not likely. \n\nAlso the hive would have cast off swarms at least twice a year if not more. Someone would have noticed. The neighbor who had lived there 13 years did not say that she had noticed them before the new tenants moved in. \n\nIs it possible that a hive moved in 10 years ago and then absconded and then years later another swarm moved in? Sure, however that is not a continuous hive in one place for ten years. Ask a beekeeper who has a hive for multiple years what he has to do with the frames after a while. He has to pull them. \n\n2) What about all that honey?\n\nIn the video she mentioned that she had tried to spray the bees with spray pesticides and didn't manage to kill the hive. \n\nThe moment any spray has gone near a hive none of the honey is suitable for consumption. Not for humans or bees. It goes in the garbage.\n\n3) The person doing the removal was a PCO (pest control operator) not a beekeeper. \n\nThe video with him on top of the ladder surrounded by thousands of bees as he pounds away in a full suit shows that pretty plainly. All he is doing is pissing off the bees. Where is his smoker? That is a great way to get people stung. A job like that requires taking the time to remove the siding and blocks carefully so as to not create that type of situation. That removal would have taken around 10 hours to do properly. \n\nYes, he plays it up to the camera. \n\nPlease note: also a removal like this would have cost her approximatly $500-$600 due to size and time it would take. Plus we are not construction contractors. So the holes would have to be repaired by a licensed contractor. When this job was done it would have cost her anywhere from $1000-$1500. I understand her not calling to have this done. It's expensive. \n\nSome notes to address other issues mentioned in the comments thread.\n\n1) Africanized bees\n\nThey are in Texas it is a possibility. It would not have changed how I dealt with it. Because be they european or africanized does not matter when you start disturbing a hive. However what he did in the video, in my opinion, create a dangerous situation. I live and work in South Florida we have AHB here. It is more hype then truth. Not to say that the bees don't test positive as AHB, they do. The aggressive nature is over rated. Also there is a simple solution. Replace the queen. \n\n2) Bee keepers do free removals\n\nMy response to that is this:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3y3QoFnqZc\n\nA few may but they would not touch a job like the one in the video for free. Call when you have a swarm four feet off the ground with easy access. Maybe then. Don't expect to call a professional and get it for free. \n\n3) Bees are dying.\n\nThe CCD issue is a fucked up situation. If you are commercial migratory beekeeper your life and job can suck. Driving 2000 + hives for almonds and losing half or more means bankruptcy in some cases. Most hobbiest beekeepers do not have CCD issues. As to the direct cause? That has not been determined despite what is said in the vanishing of the bees movie or several other documentaries. The one peer reviewed study said it was a virus and got torn apart because it was sponsored by Bayer. The people involved have basically been disgraced.  If you believe it is caused by cell phones you probably also believe that aliens abduct you in your sleep. \n\n4) For those who are scared of bees.\n\nI understand. Bees sting, it hurts when they do. If you are really allergic that can be fatal. If you ever chose to overcome your fear there are plenty of good beekeepers out there to help you. Also apitherapy seems to have a nice effect on those who use it to help with symptoms. I still think it is a bit of woo woo medicine but if it helps the person feel better. I am not going to harp to much. It does not cure anything. \n\n/rant\n\nAlso thanks to the other beekeepers who posted good responses in here. \n\nYou can see a video of me playing with some bees here. \n\nhttp://vimeo.com/27448524\n\n*edit spelling",

            "This is one of the situations where I can understand where George is coming from. The unions, guilds, and studios made it very difficult for George to make the films he wanted. To the point where George quit the directors guild and once he was able to he refused to work for any studio without full control (not everyone will get that ability). His freedom and creative bend help him and many others make one of the best FX studios ever. \n\nSo while he does not work with unions he has his reasons. You may not agree with them but his experiences left him with a justifiably bad taste in his mouth. \n\nI don't think the unions are bad but the unions are not going to work for everyone. The employees like Adam Savage who have worked for him have not said bad things about it. I think the unions serve a purpose but that doesn't mean I think they are for everyone. Gary Oldman did nothing wrong by saying I won't work in a non union shop. George did nothing wrong by saying I wont run a union shop. ",
            "It's barf.\n\nBees have two stomachs. The first stomach stores the nectar. the removal of moisture and the conversion to honey start there. \nWhen the worker bee returns to the hive it pukes the honey into a cell or shares it with another bee. \n\nThe fancy word for it is regurgitation. However it is much more fun to tell a class of 2nd graders that honey is bee barf. \n\n(Source: Owner of Bee Barf Apiaries)",

            "He was taught darkroom!\n\nFrom *The Eagle's Gift*:\n\nShe led me to an alcove in the darkest hall in her house. Although my eyes were used to the darkness I was still unable to see a thing. I stumbled on something and she commanded me to sit down inside a narrow crib and support my lower back with something I thought was a hard cushion.\n\nI next felt that she had backed up a few steps behind me, a thing which baffled me completely, for I thought that my back was only a few inches from the wall. Speaking from behind me, she ordered me in a soft voice to focus my attention on her words and let them guide me. She told me to keep my eyes open and fixed on a point right in front of me, at my eye level; and that this point was going to turn from darkness to a bright and pleasing orange-red.\n\nZuleica spoke very softly with an even intonation. I heard every word she said. The darkness around me seemed to have effectively cut off any distracting external stimuli. I heard Zuleica\u2019s words in a vacuum, and then I realized that the silence in that hall was matched by the silence inside me.\n\nZuleica explained that a dreamer must start from a point of color; intense light or unmitigated darkness are useless to a dreamer in the initial onslaught. Colors such as purple or light green or rich yellow are, on the other hand, stupendous starting points. She preferred, however, orange-red, because through experience it had proven to be the one that gave her the greatest sensation of rest. She assured me that once I had succeeded in entering into the orange-red color I would have rallied my second attention permanently, providing that I could be aware of the sequence of physical events.\n\nIt took me several sessions with Zuleica\u2019s voice to realize with my body what she wanted me to do. The advantage of being in a state of heightened awareness was that I could follow my transition from a state of vigil to a state of dreaming. Under normal conditions that transition is blurred, but under those special circumstances I actually felt in the course of one session how my second attention took over the controls. The first step was an unusual difficulty in breathing. It was not a difficulty in inhaling or exhaling; I was not short of breath \u2013 rather, my breathing changed rhythm all of a sudden. My diaphragm began to contract and it forced my midsection to move in and out with great speed. The result was the fastest short breaths I had ever taken. I breathed in the lower part of my lungs and felt a great pressure in my intestines. I tried unsuccessfully to break the spasms of my diaphragm. The harder I tried, the more painful it got....\n\n...I disregarded Zuleica\u2019s order to enter into a patch of coloration that was forming right at my eye level, and gave myself fully to the exploration of that strange sensation outside me. Zuleica must have seen what I was going through; she suddenly began to explain that the second attention belongs to the luminous body, as the first attention belongs to the physical body. The point where, she said, the second attention assembles itself was situated right where Juan Tuma had described it the first time we met \u2013 approximately one and one-half feet in front of the midpoint between the stomach and the belly button and four inches to the right....\n\n...La Gorda said that she and Josefina lived in Zuleica\u2019s house for several months. The Nagual Juan Matus had delivered them to her one day after making them shift levels of awareness. He did not tell them what they were going to do there nor what to expect, he simply left them by themselves in the hall of her house and walked away. They sat there until it got dark. Zuleica then came to them. They never saw her, they only heard her voice as if she were talking to them from a point on the wall.\n\nZuleica was very demanding from the moment she took over. She made them undress on the spot and ordered both of them to crawl inside thick fluffy cotton bags, some poncho-like garments that were lying on the floor. They covered them from neck to toes. She ordered them next to sit back to back on a mat in the same alcove where I myself used to sit. She told them that their task was to gaze at the darkness until it began to acquire a hue. After many sessions they indeed began to see colors in the darkness, at which time Zuleica made them sit side by side and gaze at the same spot.\n\nLa Gorda said that Josefina learned very fast, and that one night she dramatically entered into the patch of orange-red by swishing physically out of the poncho.

He was being taught like his predecessors were, while he was (usually) already shifted away from his a.p. position at the Blue Line by don Juan's back-slap.\n\nWe don't have that, hence the focus on the J-Curve that was presented in private classes, and now here.\n\nAlso, Carlos was a male nagual, and thus very stubborn! Part of his stubbornness, as a male, was his preoccupation with complex procedures.\n\nDon Juan played on that to keep him interested/hooked.",

            "I want to thank everyone for making his last day to play Halo on 360 so memorable with the invites and kind messages. He really appreciated it. He has been playing Halo 3 since it released. He played a little bit of Halo Reach and Halo 4, but Halo 3 was his favorite. Every day when I came home from school, I would play customs and matchmaking with my sister and my dad. We would play Halo 2/Halo 3 a lot. Friday nights he would get pizza and soda and we bonded as a family. We had many long time friends we would play hours with and have many memories with players like LoadedGeez42, TuskedSecurity, Nux, John117, Sgt Killjoy, MisterE, Mouse, ghostxyz, Sneaky.\n\nBut as time went on, I graduated high school and moved on to college, got my degree in game art and got a job and got a wife and my first house. My sister as well went off to do cosmetology, did some acting and modeling, @ 03ocbombshell20, as well being a full time manager. She has moved out and has a child with my brother-in-law. Many wouldn't even think she plays Halo but even her husband doesn't like getting beat in 1v1s on Guardian with all those years of experience she has on Halo 3.\n\nBut since we all moved on with our lives and I went on to play Halo MCC, Halo 5, Halo Wars 2, Halo Infinite, he still stayed behind and would come back from work and play Halo 3. He never got his 50, but it never stopped him from trying. Unfortunately, the population count dwindled over time and became harder to find a match. My sister and father are no longer on the best of terms anymore but I'd always still come over to visit him and my mother-in-law when I had time and he would still talk about how much fun he still has but now it takes forever for him to find a match and eventually gave up and let me have the Xbox 360 back. Then the inevitable came with the announcement the servers would go offline.\n\nAt the time I had finally extracted all the legacy custom game modes and maps I had saved on Halo 3, Halo Reach, and Halo 4 that I have been transferring over to Halo MCC. I was originally going to play the last day, like many others were going to. But when I informed him of the news, he was sad to hear that his chances of ever playing were coming to an end. I knew there would be many people wanting to play legacy Halo games one more time for nostalgia. So I wanted him to relive the old days one last time that he could reminiscence in the moment and I knew that would make him happy. So I made sure the 360 got updated and that it worked so he could turn on, sign in and play until the last day when they inevitably would shut off the servers.\n\nHe got to truly enjoy Halo 3 like how he used remember it back in the day and made some new friends. Again, thank you everyone for what you did."

At 640,000 square feet, it's almost 12 times larger than the White House.\n* There are more IKEA catalogs printed annually than copies of the Christian Bible. About 3 times as many copies.\n* IKEA's first mainstream TV commercial in the US from 1994 featured a gay couple before it was commonplace. It was pulled shortly after due to bomb threats.\n* 75% of the IKEA catalog is not actually photos of the merchandise, but in fact just CGI renderings.\n* IKEA once let loose 100 cats in a store to see what would happen and turned it into [a cool ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aUhzddiVOQ).\n* In certain regions, IKEA sells flat-pack houses you build yourself for under $100k.\n* Before opening the first store in Bangkok, IKEA hired translators to ensure none of the product names would translate into sexual acts in the local language.\n* 54% of IKEA employees are women.\n* 1 billion meatballs are sold in IKEA stores worldwide every year.\n* IKEA sells $1.5 billion in food every year, making them the 10th largest food retailer in the world.\n* In 2009, IKEA changed the typeface in their catalog from Futura to Verdana, causing minor uproar among font and furniture fans. \n\nEdit: Just watch this, even if you have already. https://youtu.be/7T2oje4cYxw",

            "I\u2019ve helped several people who didn\u2019t understand it quit for good.. when you say OF and things are a trigger, at what moment specifically do you know you\u2019re getting triggered? Also fyi there is another book arguably more effective than the easypeasy method but for all forms of social media not porn. It\u2019s written by the original author and creator of this method..easypeasy is based off the process invented by Allen Carr. So it doesn\u2019t have the problems of a \u201chack book\u201d like easypeasy. It\u2019s called Smartphone dumb phone, it\u2019s better written than easy peasy and addresses more issues of relapse. \n\nThe best thing.. smartphone dumb phone isnt like easypeasy as you dont need to quit social media completely.. that\u2019s unrealistic.. and unlike porn.. there are aspects of it that are genuinely useful. So you don\u2019t have to worry about feeling deprived or being isolated, just stop doom scrolling and other things.. like going down alleyways that lead to porn.",

            "The only point of pmoing while you\u2019re reading the book is so that the \u201cfantasy\u201d doesn\u2019t stay a fantasy. That way you get to look at what it\u2019s really doing to you, leaving you more dissatisfied and feeling worse. The point of the book is to give up any reliance on willpower, abandon it completely while reading the book, because that is how you realize you don\u2019t even need willpower to choose not to do it. If you use willpower throughout the book your left still thinking that you have to resist the temptation to do something stupid. \n\nWhat if you had a fantasy that bleach would be fucking delicious? You would have to use willpower to not drink it. If you didn\u2019t drink it you would go your whole life suffering because you think you\u2019re missing out on delicious bleach. If you tried the bleach just once you would realize it\u2019s fucking bleach, give it up, and stop moping about it.\n\nPorn is like coolaid flavored bleach. At first it tastes good but after a moment you regret what you did, realize your throat is burning and understand it added nothing to your life.\n\nWhile you\u2019re reading the book go ahead and drink your bleach if that\u2019s what you feel like doing. When you read the book this second time you\u2019ll learn fully.. to stop drinking bleach.. instead of repeatedly burning your throat for a sip of fake coolaid, go out into life and enjoy being free.\n\nWith that being said\u2026\n\nJust be because you were fantasizing. Doesn\u2019t mean you want to continue pmo\u2026\n\nWe\u2019re you able to stop fantasizing quickly and move on? If.. so then it\u2019s no problem.. but if you were sitting there drooling and fighting yourself not to pmo.. that means that the first time you read the book there was something you weren\u2019t considering.\n\nWhile you read the book the second time DO THIS and your virtually guaranteed to experience massive success.. you\u2019ve had an opportunity to figure out exactly what needs to be fixed this time around.. most people get this confused and start doubting that the book works if they have to read it a second time.. that is completely backwards, those people are doing it wrong. If you do it with the right understanding then reading the book a second time will be even more effective than the first time because now you have more perspective.\n\nAnd that means you\u2019ll be able to patch what ever you didn\u2019t do right the first time.\n\nHere\u2019s what you do\u2026 read the book again. This time while your reading it don\u2019t just think about pmo videos and shit like that. This time, when the book is giving you examples, think about pictures like the ones you were talking about. Think about the fantasies like the ones you were having.\n\nAll of the examples they give about pmo.. notice how they also apply to fantasizing and pictures exactly the same. Fantasizing about pictures is exactly the same trap as pmo whether you orgasm or not.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should do specifically:\n\nLast time you read the book you probably only noticed your thoughts and how you felt WHILE you pmo\u2019d. This time, really linger before you pmo and pay attention to your thoughts and how you feel. Even better if it\u2019s a similar situation to the one you described.\n\nYou know how the first time you read the book it started to change how you felt about porn\u2026 You were looking at pics and videos on your phone and it probably stopped being as attractive, you were probably feeling ready to quit\u2026 \n\nIf you pay attention in the way I\u2019m telling you, then the same thing will happen for the situation you described. Notice how the pictures inside your head are exactly the same as the videos. They are all just fake fleeting illusions that make you feel more anxious.\n\nThis time when you read the book, pay special attention to the pictures and fantasies in your head. Realize they are exactly the same as the videos and pictures on your screen. And as you go through ezpz this time\u2026 it will work for you all the way, dissolve the illusions and you can be completely free. It all comes down to what you focus on while you read it.\n\nGoodluck! Let me know how that works for you. Fr, dm me after you read it like that!"

            "The key to understanding the Emperor's motivations during the Crusade is that humanity is evolving into a psychic race and nothing can stop it. Psykers will become more and more common and, if they're not controlled, they will destroy humankind.\n\nSo the Emperor devises a plan to guide human psychic ascension. A key step of this plan is to sever our reliance on the Warp, by providing us an alternate means of FTL travel and communications: the Webway.\n\nThe Webway is a network of tunnels, large enough to let spaceships through, existing between realspace and the Warp but separate from either. It was built by the Old Ones and largely used by the Eldar. Though it was significantly damaged during the Eldar Empire's fall, it remains the fastest and most reliable means of travel and communications in the galaxy.\n\nThe Emperor intends to get into the Webway and conquer it for humanity. Being a control freak and a (justified) paranoid, he wants his own private, highly fortified access, and resolves to build a jerry-rigged Webway portal in the dungeon under the Imperial Palace. This is an enormous undertaking and requires using the Golden Throne as a psychic amplifier to project wards around the human-built Webway connection, since it lacks the Warp-repelling properties of the original sections.\n\nThis ends up being a terrible liability that the Emperor's enemies exploit to terrifying effect, but that's a story for another spoiler.",
            "He definitely knows. Even if he had just been stuck in there looking at the Warp for ten thousand years speaking to no living soul, he'd know. The Emperor is such a presence in the Warp, his worship so widespread, his influence so all-encompassing, that he couldn't not know.\n\nHe's had near ten thousand years to figure what to do with that knowledge. I bet whatever he's come up with is pretty good.",

            "Clearly, you have no idea how newspapers and magazines work.\n\nWriters and editors create articles that the target reader wants to read. The readers get the publication (free or paid) because they want to read the articles. The editorial staff puts its attention on that goal, with barely a glance at the ad sales department. (Not to mention that the two crowds drink in different bars.)\n\nWhatever the (print) publication, the role of the ad sales people is to sell advertising. Their efforts to sell ads depend on the perception of who reads the publication. Sometimes there is a clear, direct correlation. For instance, in its heyday, PC Magazine sold a lot of ads to printer manufacturers. And sometimes less so; luxury travel magazines' readers are high-income, so the ad sales people can tell would-be advertisers that the readers can afford to buy their expensive scotch and golf equipment. \n\nBut what the ad sales department does -- and the publisher who directs that staff -- has extremely little to do with what the editorial department does. There is almost no interaction between the two departments. \n\nThe summary of the business model is that the ad sales department sells the readers' eyeballs to the advertiser. \n\nAnd as others have pointed out, the audience for the \"alternative press\" (like the Village Voice and Tony's previous home at the Phoenix New Times) has always been counter-culture. The New Times, for instance, wrote about politics in Arizona -- exposing corruption -- back when the Arizona Republic was strongly right wing. It also had the best music reviews and restaurant reviews. I'm not exaggerating when I say that people would line up to wait for the paper to come out, particularly for its Best of Arizona issue. ...and because these alternative papers were so popular for those sort of features, it became the obvious place to go to find restaurant coupons in the paper (provided by those advertisers), music event calendars (and ads for the clubs), and... other things. Lots of classifieds for hookups, back in the day, before Craigslist killed them. (Craigslist destroyed newspaper classifieds overall, and that was a major profit source for them.... but that's another discussion.) \n\nThe alternative press's ads got more tawdry over the years. And if they ended up in a smarmy place, I am not surprised. But none of it is a shocker. ...and none of it has anything to do with the editor responsible for the articles.\n\nThis is a long winded way of saying that you don't know what you're talking about. And also letting lurkers know that we all are aware of your ignorance on the topic. ...So yeah, this is an attempted smear job, and a terribly executed one.",

            "If there's any sentence I've heard uttered by people who left Scientology (or just the Sea Org), it's, \"I realized that this wasn't the organization I thought it was,\" or sometimes, \"It wasn't the organization that I'd \\[thought I'd\\] joined.\" In other words, they get burned out when they discover that their idealistic expectations are inaccurate. When that happens, it happens because of something they experience themselves -- not based on warnings that other people gave them.\n\nThink of this as if your friend were marrying someone whom you believe would be terrible for them. You might point out the \"obvious\" faults, like, \"He shows signs of being an alcoholic\" or \"He hasn't managed to hold a job for 3 months.\" But few people listen to friends when they are in love... and that seems to be true for any kind of devotion. I guess we have to make some mistakes the hard way. (When I told my family that I was divorcing my first husband, my dumbest sister-in-law replied, \"We wondered how long it'd take.\")\n\nIn other words -- I don't think that there is anything you can say or do to dissuade your friend.\n\nThat's even more so if she's in a Scientology family. I'm sure there are other family dynamics involved, such as \"Grandpa will be so proud of me!\" For many of us, joining Scientology could be viewed (at least by family) as \"rebelling against our expectations\" but it doesn't seem like she's doing that.\n\nThe only advice that I can offer is to be sure to convey to her that you love her and want the best for her... and that you will support any decision she makes, even if you disagree with it. (Like you would with the bad boyfriend.) MAKE IT SAFE FOR HER TO RETURN TO YOU so that she doesn't feel like you'll say, \"I told you so.\" You don't want her embarrassment (\"oh god my friends were right!\") to be a factor in her staying. \n\nAlso, you don't want to present yourself as being antagonistic to Scientology... or she will be forbidden to say in touch with her.\n\nOne specific bit of advice that I picked up recently: DO stay in touch with her, even if it's just birthday cards, \"thinking of you.\" Include photos of your gang of friends, such as wedding photos or baby pictures. When/if she's ready to leave she'll still have that bit of a connection to you. \n\nAnd the cards' return address will always let her know there's a safe space, should she ever need a place to escape to. (When I left, my first thought for a destination was my college roommate's apartment. That didn't work out for Reasons, but \\_it was a place to go\\_. And it would have been a couch to crash on while I tried to reassemble my life.)",
            "I'll go first.\n\nWe left with no money -- a total of $400, his car, and all our belongings stuffed into it. Initially we tried to find work in the city where we \"disappeared\" to, but even in 1980 we didn't have enough cash to find a place to stay, get a phone (because any job, even Kelly Girl temp work, required one), and wait out the two weeks until a first paycheck arrived. We ended up sleeping in the car and buying groceries you could eat without prep; there was one day when all I had was a carton of milk and a package of cinnamon rolls.\n\nWhen this sank in a few weeks later, I sold some jewelry (including my gold class ring), MrFZaP called in a loan of $70 from an old friend, and we scraped together enough money to drive to my parents' house (not something anybody embraced) on the other side of the country. We lived with my folks until we found work, saved the money for an apartment (with nothing in it except a waterbed someone gave us for free), and got started on new careers.\n\nMeanwhile, we were going through emotional turmoil. In the space of eight weeks, the two of us went from the certainty of \"I know what I'll be doing the rest of my life, and with whom\" to \"I have to reconsider everything I accepted as true.\" (One romantic note: Neither of us ever questioned our love and support for each other.) It was a confusing tailspin on top of \"What will we eat?!\"\n\nBut *in many ways we were lucky*. Our families -- who had been critical of us personally and of Scientology -- bit back their \"I told you so\" temptations and took us in. My sister participated in our leaving-logistics by being a message drop-box; I don't know how it would have worked out otherwise.\n\nAnd we had careers to fall back on. We'd only been on staff for a few years. I called a previous employer (originally a summer job) who said, \"Can you start Monday?\" MrFZaP had a marketable skill that was suited for \"show us how you do it\" so they weren't interested in what it said (or didn't say) on his resume. We had full-time jobs within a week of getting to my parents' city, even if they were entry-level in terms of salary; both of us got raises, bonuses, and promotions. We, ahem, \"made it go right.\"\n\nWhat would it be like today, though? Someone leaving after 5 or 10 years would be far behind on any kind of career path. They'd lack cultural literacy, from how to use a cell phone to familiarity with common office tools. Their educational history would confuse a would-be employer. I know how much of a barrier it was, a few years after I moved cross-country, to figure out what to put on a resume. (Surely, \"I worked for a cult\" would not impress anybody.) And while most of my friends were never in the CofS, most people leaving today are splitting from the only friends-and-family they've ever known.\n\nIt wasn't until years later that I discovered that I had had more options than I knew about. Maybe we didn't need to drive cross-country, for instance. I learned, eventually, that the food co-op we later joined had facilities to help people out. We could have volunteered to work at the co-op, gotten some basic food, and probably have gotten a couch to sleep on for a week or two. Who knows where that might have led? And it would have meant that we did not feel alone.\n\nI cannot express with enough passion or urgency how valuable it is to have the Aftermath Foundation as a viable exit strategy. Please don't fuck it up."

In terms of recency, approximately 60% of men reported engaging in masturbation in the prior month as compared to 36.5% of women. Also, about one-quarter of women reported never having engaged in solo masturbation compared with 10.4% of men.

            "Well-meaning people always believe that help is readily available. \"See a therapist,\" they'll say. \"Or go to a rape crisis center.\"\n\nUnless they've personal experience of trying to find it for themselves or for a family-member or friend, they've no understanding of how minimal are the resources that exist. In a lot of countries -- Britain, New Zealand, much of Canada -- most rape-crisis centers are women-only. Those that aren't often confine the assistance they offer to men to counselling by telephone, sometimes for just a couple of hours a week. Many of the most effective forms of intervention, like support groups, don't exist. Male counsellors are extremely unusual; the constantly reiterated claim is that one (female) size fits all. Where RCCs are open to men, as in the United States, no serious training is provided to staff on the realities of male sexual victimization (in fairness to them, at present there's nowhere to go to get such training). Even if a male client succeeds in overcoming the obstacles in his way, then, he'll almost certainly be dealing with someone who is learning on the job, and who may or may not be all that keen on interacting with male rape victims in the first place.\n\nWhat's true of the RCC sector is no less the case among the psychiatric and psychotherapeutic professions. No training; practically no awareness; inadequate clinical research; lots of unhelpful preconceptions that will need to be overcome.\n\nPeople here on Reddit get very angry whenever I point this out. They'd like to believe that effective help can be had for the asking, although none can actually say from a standpoint of genuine knowledge where it is to be had. So they insist that it's there, because it *must* be.\n\nThe most important and urgent requirement for men who have been raped is the availability of accessible services geared to our needs. We don't have that yet, or anything like it, anywhere in the world. Until people are willing to address that shortcoming, nothing else will do much good.\n\n",
            "Mod here from r/rape (also the father of a daughter). Some suggestions, from our end of things:-\n\n1. You've handled it very well thus far; your instincts have guided you correctly. Go on trusting those instincts.\n\n2. As you already know, do not attack, threaten to attack, or express to your daughter your desire to attack, the perp. Any of these will only make the situation worse.\n\n3. Don't offer advice. If asked for it, state it, once, and then let the matter go. The only person with a vote on how to deal with a rape is the person who has been raped.\n\n4. Treat her as normally as you can. It's very debilitating, for a rape victim, having to manage other people's emotional reactions. Still worse is having to *be* \"the rape victim\" around well-meaning people, when in fact you just want to be ordinary and watch the football, or rag on the Kardashians, or whatever. And as a father of an adult daughter, especially, don't get protective. Yes, I know that goes against all our instincts. Do it anyway.\n\n5. If she wants to talk, just listen. No questions, no recommendations, no interpretations. Keep quiet and listen. That's the golden rule. In any situation when you haven't a clue what to say or do next, you'll never go far wrong if you just listen.\n\n6. Because she seems on top of things now doesn't mean that she won't find herself overwhelmed by what's happened weeks, months or years from now. That's not unusual. Neither is it a sign that everything's going to hell. Rape takes people in different ways, at different times. Be prepared for that if it happens.\n\n7. Practical help -- the kind that fathers are especially good at -- is often the best kind of help. Mowing grass. Stocking refrigerators. Lifting some of the everyday burdens of life that, when one is going through a rough patch, seem almost impossible.\n\n8. This is exceptionally difficult for you and your wife as well. Be gentle and forgiving with each other, and with yourselves. Look for external sources of support for each of you, anywhere you can get it.\n\n9. Read up on this stuff when you get a chance. The knowledge gained will never go to waste.\n\n10. When all else fails -- and it will -- re-read item 5 above, and remember the Golden Rule.",

            "This is near the airport, on the western outskirts of town. Sarajevo was the capital of Bosnia; the Serbs laid siege to it for nearly four years. They dug artillery into the surrounding hills and lobbed shells more or less indiscriminately into the city center. Snipers in high-rise buildings took pot-shots at civilians as they tried to get from one part of town to the other, with this spot being a gauntlet that people had to run to reach the center of town. In the end, the Bosnians dug a tunnel under the airport runway, making transit a good deal safer. Today you can visit one of the entrances, which has become a small museum. I was there last year. There isn't too much to see -- the tunnel itself is closed off for safety reasons -- but it's worth a look nonetheless.\n\n",
            "Hate to be nitpicky, but I wouldn't say that there are more than 200,000 people in that shot, far less two million.\n\nBy the look of things, the photographer was shooting out of an upstairs window on the east side of 7th Avenue and 44th St, directly across from the old Hotel Astor (now the site of the One Astor Plaza office building), and looking southward. The far end of the crowd, extending along 7th and Broadway, peters out at or near West 38th. If we assume that there were as many people behind the photographer as in front, that still wouldn't get us to half a million.\n\nPeople typically over-estimate crowd sizes. A good rule of thumb is that the maximum number of human beings you can get in a densely-packed standing crowd is five to the square metre. (Grab four of your friends; wedge them together; and see just how tight that really is.) Anything more than that is highly dangerous, risking the kind of crushing deaths one saw at the Hillsborough Stadium disaster in England in 1989."

Too many triggers now.\n\n\\~An entire nearby town where she would meet him and go to lots of places in that town.\n\n\\~Carefree and intimate sex.\n\n\\~A mind that doesn't include the ability to viciously hate.\n\n\\~A year of fun memories. Memories of vacations and birthdays and christmas and everything in between is now tainted.\n\n\\~My future. I used to enjoy planning a vacation or thinking about doing things in the future. The future is now entirely in question.\n\n\\~Pride in my wife and our marriage.\n\n\\~My stability.\n\n\\~Relaxation. Just fucking no.\n\n\\~My unwavering faithfulness. I now look at women and consider them as a possible replacement for my wife. I wonder how we'd get along. I wonder if we have common interests. I wonder about sex with them. I never used to consider those things.\n\n\\~My ability to feel good for young people in love. My ability to smile at the new relationships my sons have with their girlfriends. Now I just assume that one of them will be devastated and need to go through the same trauma I am going through.\n\n\\~Sleep. I almost never sleep through the night like I did before Dday. I would say I get about 60-70%.\n\n\\~Nightmare-free nights. A large percentage of my nights include nightmares of her fucking him unprotected in front of me.

My guess is that I could be adding to this list regularly especially if I include the ability to just look at, think about, hear, see, pass by, feel, smell or touch any of an increasing list of items, places, etc that are now triggers into unease, panic attacks or full PTSD events.

            "Yeah, as a native Hebrew speaker, this is sadly not true. Leviticus 18:22 says nothing about young boys. The word it uses, \u05d6\u05b8\u05db\u05b8\u0594\u05e8, means \"male\". Here's a word-by-word [breakdown](https://biblehub.com/text/leviticus/18-22.htm). This is really just an attempt by people to retrofit the Bible to align with modern sensibilities. For example, the other big anti-gay verse in the Bible - Leviticus 20:13 - makes it clear this is not about protecting children from pedophiles, since the punishment for male-male sex there is death for both participants:\n\n>If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13, NIV).\n\nIf this was really about anti-pedophilia, then why put the kid to death? The answer is because it's just plain homophobia, even if it was inspired mostly by the social context of man-boy relationships.",

            "As the lead mod of /r/roblox, player since 2007, and even an in-game GM from 2011-2013, let me explain a few things.\n\nThe main thing is the Developer Exchange, or DevEx. It allows users to trade the ingame currency (Robux) for real hard cash. Developers can then make a game using Roblox Studio, sell things in game (like gear, upgrades, boosts, the standard stuff) and the developers get a cut. I think the ratio is 70% to devs and 30% to Roblox.\n\nPeople have entire dev teams entirely funded by Roblox DevEx payouts. This is their full time job. They know their audience well so they can market it and play their cards right.\n\nThis does have a major downside of the fact that they are children and there's not too much in the way of protection from fishy/scummy practices. Lootboxes are insanely common, cash-grab games that entirely require paying to proceed, etc. It's very similar to the problem of mobile games on app stores we have now, but entirely at children.\n\nI think this will be the next major problem Roblox will need to tackle in the next few years, as people like me who grew up playing it are now old enough to raise children, and the impression the game leaves as you get older is... not great. For example, /r/Roblox passed 100k subs not too long ago while /r/GoCommitDie, a subreddit basically about making fun of Roblox, has nearly 400k.

            ">A flu shot is a vaccine, right?\n\nYes.\n\n>What is the reason for this\n\nCDC has addressed some misconceptions:\n\n>>What about people who get a seasonal flu vaccine and still get sick with flu symptoms?\n\n>>There are several reasons why someone might get a flu symptoms, even after they have been vaccinated against flu.\n\n>>* One reason is that some people can become ill from other respiratory viruses besides flu such as rhinoviruses, which are associated with the common cold, cause symptoms similar to flu, and also spread and cause illness during the flu season. The flu vaccine only protects against influenza, not other illnesses.\n*  Another explanation is that it is possible to be exposed to influenza viruses, which cause the flu, shortly before getting vaccinated or during the two-week period after vaccination that it takes the body to develop immune protection. This exposure may result in a person becoming ill with flu before protection from the vaccine takes effect.\n>* A third reason why some people may experience flu like symptoms despite getting vaccinated is that they may have been exposed to a flu virus that is very different from the viruses the vaccine is designed to protect against. The ability of a flu vaccine to protect a person depends largely on the similarity or \u201cmatch\u201d between the viruses selected to make the vaccine and those spreading and causing illness. There are many different flu viruses that spread and cause illness among people. For more information, see\u00a0Influenza (Flu) Viruses.\n>* The final explanation for experiencing flu symptoms after vaccination is that the flu vaccine can\u00a0vary in how well it works\u00a0and some people who get vaccinated may still get sick.\n\n...\n>are flu shots really that important?\n\nI think the flu vs flu shot answers this the best:\n\n>>Is it better to get the flu than the flu vaccine?\n\n>>No. Flu can be a serious disease, particularly among young children, older adults, and people with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease or diabetes. Any flu infection can carry a risk of serious complications, hospitalization or death, even among otherwise healthy children and adults. Therefore, getting vaccinated is a safer choice than risking illness to obtain immune protection.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/misconceptions.htm\n\nFeel free to check out r/ID_News for infectious disease news.",

I had already said the filters to remove content by word association. And the community was set to nsfw. I deleted my user account, owing to the fact that I wanted my community to be tied to the same name, with it being \"banned\" I didn't have a use for the account.

The moderation team is volunteering their time to find and share some live music from throughout the years, as we work to get the subreddit re-opened as soon as possible.\n\n**Once we've found a suitable replacement for our bots/servers that won't cost our team money (or create an unreasonable workload for our moderators), we'll be reopening as soon as we can.** We certainly appreciate everyone who's showed their continued support and patience.\n\nWe hope to hear from the site owners/admins, and are disappointed by their response thus far. That said, we have nothing new to report about our discussions with them.\n\n* Hosting - We did not feel comfortable handing over our code to Reddit, and had no guarantee that it would run properly, nor were we given any other details to make us feel as though this was a good decision. (We think Reddit should be developing more tools for moderators.)\n* Coding - We will be re-organizing r/Music to operate without one or more of the bots/servers we relied on.\n\n9pm 6/17 Updates:\n\nSpecific to r/Music:\n\n* Bots/servers - Admins have confirmed, one-by-one, that six of our most-important bots/server accounts should not be impacted by forthcoming changes.\n* Hosting - Admins have offered information regarding Reddit potentially hosting some or all of our code.\n* Moderator Toolbox - Admins have confirmed that Mod Toolbox and similar tools will not be affected.\n* We will be reaching out to our coders and the rest of our moderation team to discuss ongoing events.\n\nBlackout-specific:\n\n* We have not been made aware of any worthwhile updates relating to third-party apps, accesssibility features, Reddit's app, or API fees. \n\nWe will post more updates as they become available.",

            "Your shed. \n\nSeriously.\n\n**LOCK YOUR FUCKING SHED**.\n\nEven if your house is well locked, if your shed isn't I likely have access to a plethora of tools I can use to gain access. Don't help the burglar. Lock your shed.",
            "\"Zero Tolerance\"\n\nJust means that if someone starts a fight with you, you fight back as hard as you can. You're going to get suspended for defending yourself anyway, might as well make it worthwhile.",
            "I am not religious.\n\nI am *morally* against abortions (for non-medical reasons) because I believe it's a tragedy. It's a life that could have been and has been snuffed out before it ever had a chance. If it's deemed medically necessary to preserve the life of the mother then that is different.\n\nI am *legally* pro-choice because I don't believe someone has a right to the body of someone else. Even if they need that body in order to survive.\n\nIt is perfectly acceptable to have a moral opinion, and a legal opinion, that are in opposition to each other. It simply means you understand that your morality should not dictate what other people can and cannot do. \n\nThis is something that I feel has been largely lost from public discourse. The ability to have nuance. To say \"I don't like X. But I understand that my personal views do not, and should not, constitute laws. Instead we need to look at the deeper issues and decide if a law is truly necessary, or if it should be left to the individual.\"\n\nIn almost all cases I believe issues should be left to the individual.",

            "Really? It's pretty simple to understand, it's just not comfortable:\n\n1. Cheap Chinese slave labor makes products less expensive.\n2. This makes products have higher profit margins while maintaining relatively low prices.\n3. The average person gets creature comforts at affordable prices, the rich get massive profit margins, and the politicians get a distraction from their own misdeeds because \"Well look what they're doing\"\n\nNobody is doing anything about it because nobody **WANTS** to do anything (meaningful) about it.\n\n* Oh I can't stop buying Chinese products says the consumer, the manufacturer should stop making them.\n* Oh I can't stop making them says the manufacturer, the consumer is unwilling to pay higher prices.\n* Oh I can't do anything says the politician, trade sanctions would upset both the consumer and manufacturer.\n\nEveryone wants someone else to do something about it, nobody wants to actually do it.\n\nEdit:\n\nWant me to prove it? You're doing it right now.\n\nReddit Inc is owned, in part, by [Tencent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent). Which is basically a shell company for the CCP to ~~infiltrate~~ ~~influence~~ invest in western companies and back flow profits.\n\nEdit 2: Why my comment is hidden.\n\n[Reddit has a feature called crowd control](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/e8vl4d/announcing_the_crowd_control_beta/). It's in beta and still clunky. Because I am not actually subscribed to r/gifs, my comment is auto-hidden. I like r/gifs I just prefer to visit it dedicated instead of haivng it sprinked into my feed.\n\nThis is something the mods choose to implement, in part at least, and it can be very useful. I use it on the subs I mod. \n\nThat said it is not without flaws. IMO the problem is it's a slider, and not a series of tick boxes.\n\nThere's A, B, and C. But the only options are:\n\n* A\n* A&B\n* A&B&C\n\nYou can't do just B or A&C but !B. Poorly implemented imo. So if they want to crowd control out criteria C, they *ALSO* need to do A&B. It's nothing nefarious."
