She was actually 14. Sex was consensual (it was admitted in court by both parties) but she not known  to be underage at that time.\n\nMother of the girl said she did not want to press any charges on the 19yo male because it was not his fault. The 14 year old admitted fully to what she had done and said she wanted to be in trouble, but she did not receive any punishment. \n\nThe judge on the case was angry that the 19 year old male used the Internet to meet girls.\nQuote from judge\n>\"That seems to be part of our culture now,\" he said, according to a transcript. \"Meet, have sex, hook up, sayonara. Totally inappropriate behavior. There is no excuse for this whatsoever,\"\n\nThe 19 year old was sentenced to be registered as a sex offender for 25 years, was forced to move out of his parent house because of a brother who is 15 and he is banned from using the Internet. That also goes along with not being able to go to public places such as parks and malls or wherever underage kids are going to be, which is pretty much anywhere.\n\nEdit: people are asking how the police found out, the mother called them when she thought her daughter went missing. The two had met in a park and had sex in his car. Through the mother reporting her missing and through the investigation they found out that the two had met and engaged in sex several weeks after she was reported missing.\n\nThe 19 yo male Zachery just finished 90 days in jail for this and now is on 5 years probation\nhere is the change.org petition to help the kid out\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/justice-for-zachery-anderson\n\nEdit Edit: seems to be a lot of people commenting that I reposted this since its been a few times for a week.

But because emergency fees are set by city ordinance, it has no ability to lower them if an insurer pays less than the billed amount, the statement said.\n\n\u201cHaving in-network contracts would require the City to write-off (reducing debt) any unpaid balance after receiving the in-network rates from the insurance company and co-pay/deductible from the patient. Under the State of Texas Constitution, Article III, Section 55, the City is prohibited from reducing the debt amount.\u201d the statement said.\n\nPrivate ambulance companies similarly tend to avoid joining insurance networks because they say insurers offer in-network rates too low to be sustainable for their businesses.\n\nCommunity Health Choice, a regional insurer in Houston, said its overall ambulance claims are down from 2019 - but the dollar amount of out-of-network ambulance claims have been steadily rising in recent months.\n\nIn July, during the worst of the summer spike of COVID-19 cases in the Houston region, the average out-of-network charge for a ground ambulance was $2,063 - the highest it has been in the past two years and 33 percent higher than the previous July, the data shows.\n\nThe Houston problem is state-wide. In 2019, with the passage of SB1264, Texas went from having one of the worst records for surprise medical bills to having some of the toughest patient protection laws in the nation. But ambulance service was not included in the 2019 protections. Only Colorado and Maine have recently included some ambulance services in their patient protection laws.",

            "The origin story \nLouis XIII\u2019s creator is Renato Viola who makes the pizza for a select crowd in Salerno, a coastal city in Italy. At 20 cm, this pizza serves two people. The best part about the pizza is that you can customise it to your preference.  \n\nThe creator  \nRenato Viola is a master pizza chef and amongst Italy's finest\u202fcuisine\u202fexperts. He is also a member of the\u202fItalian Acrobatic Pizza Team and is one of the most renowned pizza makers across the globe.  \n\nThe preparation \nViola\u2019s creation, Louis XIII takes 72 hours to prepare. Viola is helped by a sommelier (a wine specialist) and another chef while making it. It is a flat pie made out of the most refined flour.\u202fConsidering it's the most expensive pizza in the world, the Louis XIII doesn't just come in any old pizza box. Instead, it's served with special dishes and cutlery provided by Viola's team. A generous spread of Mozarella\u202fdi bufala, cheese made out of the milk collected from domestic Italian buffaloes gives the pizza its signature moist, chewy and cheesy touch.  \n\nThe most exclusive ingredients which are also the most expensive are the\u202flobsters which are prepared and flamed with cognac. Other exotic toppings that go into making the most expensive pizza are three types of exotic caviars, Mediterranean species of Shrimp and the Australian pink salt handpicked from river Murray.\u202f \n\nAs you'd imagine, a side of Pepsi won't do this pizza justice. So instead, the Louis XIII is paired with, not one, but three types of alcohol: cognac, champagne, and brandy, or more specifically, Remy Martin Cognac Louis XIII, Champagne Krug Clos Du Mesnil 1995, and Cardenal Mendoza Sanchez Charter Real Romate Finos. This is just as important to the meal as the pizza itself, especially since the pizza shares a name with the cognac with which it is served."

            "I first saw this posted in a \"things you didn't know about movies\" type thread which I can't find back, where they suggested that Gaston was actually a protagonist in Beauty and the Beast. I can only find it in an unrelated thread now ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2q3g4c/i_woke_up_and_opened_my_computer_to_this_courtesy/ )\n\n----\n\nIn Beauty and the Beast, Gaston ate four dozen eggs daily when he was a child. That's fourty-eight eggs a day. As an adult he adds another dozen, tallying up to sixty eggs a day. This is nothing short of genocide.\n\nMy theory for why Gaston is beloved by the townsfolk is that some time prior to the start of the movie, France was overrun with poultry. Helpless at the claws of the chickens, the people of France were preparing to abandon their country, when a lone child stepped forward. \"I'll eat the eggs\", a young Gaston bellowed, \"And I will save our homeland\". And so it was, Gaston ate and ate until he was roughly the size of a barge. How the cholesterol didn't kill him can only be attributed to his inhuman fortitude. This is where the story turns tragic.\n\nWhat Gaston hadn't accounted for was developing an addiction to the eggs. As he aged, he ate more and more, and with the chicken-crisis over, his addiction began costing him financially. There's a scene during Gaston's song where he motions to a wall full of his hunting trophies. But why are they there? Does he own the bar? No, he sold them for egg money. The fact he never brings up his egg addiction or his prior heroism can be attributed to another one of Gaston's defining character traits: his struggle to be emotionally open, and his modesty. It's not easy being the man who saved France.\n\nI think the saddest scene is when Belle shows Gaston the book, and he holds it upside down. See, Gaston seems brutish, but remember - his entire childhood was spent eating eggs. He didn't have time for an education; he sacrificed his upbringing for his countrymen. He can't even hold a book correctly. What Gaston wants to say, what he's struggling to articulate, is \"Belle, I'm dying. A life long diet of a quite frankly insane number of eggs has left my body bloated with tumors. Before I shove off this mortal coil, I want children, who might experience a world without the oppression I have suffered\". Belle cruelly mocks him, which goes to make you wonder who the real beast is.\n\nWhen Gaston sees the Beast in the mirror, two thoughts run through his head. First, he sees his countrymen in danger once more, and despite being riddled with egg-tumors, wants to lead the masses to one last charge of glory since fighting for France is all he knows. Second, he realizes Beast's head is about a month's worth of egg-money. So he sieges the castle, and in one of Disney's most tragic moments, plummets to his death.\n\nAnother reason Gaston wants to marry Belle is because, as mentioned above, all he knows how to do is to fight for France and its people. Gaston saw Maurice as a genuine danger, and he's not wrong; consider the hellish contraption Maurice created. One look at that war machine and Gaston hatched a plan; marry Belle, and get close enough to Maurice to talk him down. Mind you, he did love Belle, and wanted to be the father of her children, but the danger presented by Maurice forced his plan into action immediately. When that fell through, he had no choice but to throw Maurice in the asylum (something marrying Belle would have fixed, since he would once again be close enough to Maurice to influence him).\n\nAll in all, the failure was one of articulation.",

Yeltsin slurred his words in a loud argument with the baffled agents. He did not want to go back into Blair House, where he was staying. He wanted a taxi to go out for pizza. . .\n\nBut it doesn't end there, you should read the rest of the Boris Yeltsin Pizza Quest story, it's a trip.

            "So, the first question is, \"How can you find new pages in a manuscript?\" Well, this happens more often than you might think. When paper is valuable, either through the cost of production or scarcity, people seek to recycle it, removing or covering the previous text so the page can be reused. Modern imaging techniques are letting us recover text from historical manuscripts, and so these finds will become increasingly common. So, in effect, Frank applied a form of whiteout on a page that had text she would have been embarrassed by later, as she had previously stated on the page: \n\n> I'll use this spoiled page to write down 'dirty' jokes\n\nAnd so she wrote down four dirty jokes, an imagined talk with someone else about sex education, and mentions some prostitutes her father had told her about. I think many teenagers have this kind of the experience, an interest in sex and edgy jokes, and then the desire to hide that interest in the \"forbidden.\" Ann Frank is so often held up as an icon, but these things can make it easier for teens who are often assigned to read her dairy to connect, and so this is a great find.

            "Relevant paper:\n\n>Many people like eating meat, but most are reluctant to harm things that have minds. The current three studies show that this dissonance motivates people to deny minds to animals. Study 1 demonstrates that animals considered appropriate for human consumption are ascribed diminished mental capacities. Study 2 shows that meat eaters are motivated to deny minds to food animals when they are reminded of the link between meat and animal suffering. Finally, Study 3 provides direct support for our dissonance hypothesis, showing that expectations regarding the immediate consumption of meat increase mind denial. Moreover, this mind denial in turn reduces negative affect associated with dissonance. The findings highlight the role of dissonance reduction in facilitating the practice of meat eating and protecting cultural commitments.\n\n\u2014 [Don't Mind Meat?

            ">Here are some of the ways Democrats won out in this bill, despite being in the minority in both houses:\n\n>* $1.6 billion for border fencing, but with the specification that it only apply to existing designs, meaning no wall.\n\n\n>* The Fix NICS Act, which modestly improves the existing gun background-check system, plus a provision instructing the Centers for Disease Control that it is free to conduct research on gun violence. Such research was effectively stopped in 1996.\n\n\n>* A slight increase to the IRS budget. While not nearly what the agency needs, especially given the challenge of implementing the new tax law, at least it doesn\u2019t continue the long-standing GOP effort to starve the IRS of funds and make enforcement a joke.\n\n\n>* $380 million in assistance to states to improve the security of their election systems, and $300 million to the FBI to combat Russian hacking of those systems.\n\n\n>* No repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which prevents churches from endorsing candidates and acting as political organizations. President Trump has advocated that the amendment be repealed.\n\n\n>* A bar on employers such as restaurants keeping any portion of workers\u2019 tips. The Trump Labor Department had proposed allowing tip \u201cpooling,\u201d including letting the boss control and potentially take workers\u2019 tips.\n\n\n>* Increases for the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. Trump had proposed eliminating them entirely.\n\n\n>* No cuts to the EPA (Trump had proposed cutting the agency\u2019s budget by a third) and an increase in funding for clean energy research through ARPA-E, which Trump had proposed eliminating entirely.\n\n\n>* Increased funding for affordable housing.\n\n\n>* Increased education funding, along with what nearly everyone is describing as a complete rejection of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u2019s agenda.\n\n\n>* Increased funding for the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\n>* A doubling of child-care funding for low-income families.\n\n\n>* No defunding of sanctuary cities or Planned Parenthood.\n\n\nEdit: Some additional stuff from [this Vox article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/22/17150062/omnibus-spending-bill-march-ryan-mcconnell-congress):\n\n>* The White House wanted to strip $900 million in funding for the Gateway project, a $30 billion endeavor to add a new commuter rail tunnel between New Jersey and New York under the Hudson River. Ultimately, the $900 million wasn\u2019t included, but hundreds of millions in unallocated funding that could wind up going to the project did make it in.\n\n>* The Census Bureau will get another $1.34 billion, a Democratic priority.\n\n>* The Community Development Block Grant program, a flexible federal funding program for cities and local governments, is being nearly doubled from $2.8 billion to $5.2 billion, despite Trump\u2019s prior proposals to eliminate it.\n\n>* TIGER, a grant program for transportation projects inaugurated by Obama\u2019s stimulus, is seeing its budget tripled to $1.5 billion."

The last couple years, the summers have been so dry and hot that the duff in the coastal range felt parched and crusty until early October. Even if the chanterelles were fruiting, they often were not showing because they couldn't easily push through the duff. This year, the topsoil has been retaining more moisture and I've been founding chanterelles in ever increasing quantities since Labor Day. If the current weather pattern holds (intermittent rainy/dry days and cooler temps) and frost doesn't come too early, we might see a record year for chanterelles.",

            "Lawyer here. I've skimmed the decision, and here's what happened.\n\nThe main reason this case was overturned was because in 2005 the Montgomery County District Attorney effectively promised never to prosecute Cosby for raping Andrea Costand (through a public press release saying he was not going to prosecute Cosby), believing that there was no way he could get a conviction, and seeking to give her some justice by helping her when she sued him for the assault in civil court.\n\nBecause the DA had said they were not going to prosecute him, Cosby was unable to \"plead the 5th\" in the civil lawsuit and was forced to admit under oath at depositions to giving multiple women Quaaludes before he sexually assaulted them, and even said he gave Costand multiple Benadryl before he assaulted her.\n\nYears later, a new Montgomery County DA said that the DA in 2005 hadn't formally bound the state, and therefore she could go forward with prosecuting him. At the trial, Cosby's lawyers argued that he couldn't be prosecuted because of what the DA did in 2005, but the judge said that earlier decision was not enforceable and allowed Cosby to be prosecuted, in part because there was no *signed* non-prosecute agreement, only the public statement.\n\nToday the Pennsylvania Supreme Court disagreed ([link to decision is here](https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-100-2020mo%20-%20104821740139246918.pdf?cb=1)), saying that:\n\n>For the reasons detailed below, we hold that, when a prosecutor makes an unconditional promise of non-prosecution, and when the defendant relies upon that guarantee to the detriment of his constitutional right not to testify, the principle of fundamental fairness that undergirds due process of law in our criminal justice system demands that the promise be enforced.\n\nIn other words, the DA in 2005 promised not to prosecute Cosby for raping Costand (in an effort to allow her to sue him civilly), that must be enforced, and therefore Cosby goes free.\n\nThere are other aspects to the decision, but that's the big one.",
            "This is [a historic decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf) which will protect hundreds of thousands of LGBT employees from discrimination. The opinion was 6-3, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Roberts, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Breyer. Kavanugh, Alito, and Thomas dissented.\n\nAs of today, the Supreme Court puts being gay or transgender in the same category as being black when it comes to employment discrimination. You cannot fire or discriminate against an employee for being black and you cannot fire or discriminate against an employee for being gay or trans.\n\nHere are the opening two paragraphs. They explain everything you need to know:\n\n>Sometimes small gestures can have unexpected consequences. Major initiatives practically guarantee them. In\nour time, few pieces of federal legislation rank in significance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There, in Title VII,\nCongress outlawed discrimination in the workplace on the\nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Today,\nwe must decide whether an employer can fire someone\nsimply for being homosexual or transgender. The answer\nis clear. An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different\nsex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the\ndecision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\n\n>Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have\nanticipated their work would lead to this particular result.\nLikely, they weren\u2019t thinking about many of the Act\u2019s consequences that have become apparent over the years, including its prohibition against discrimination on the basis\nof motherhood or its ban on the sexual harassment of male\nemployees. But the limits of the drafters\u2019 imagination supply no reason to ignore the law\u2019s demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it\u2019s no contest. Only\nthe written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to\nits benefit.",

I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.\"\n\nAnd then almost immediately after he said that, Trump took a call from Erdogan who asked him to pull out (not expecting Trump to say yes), and Trump just said \"Fuck it, we're pulling out\" and made the order without any support from the military. And Mattis resigned and so did this guy.",

A few minutes later, [rioters were wandering around the floor of the Senate chamber](https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1346910235399659532), having fully broken in.\n\nEdit 10: As of 2:55, apparently [the Department of Defense has denied a request](https://twitter.com/byaaroncdavis/status/1346908166030766080) to deploy the DC National Guard, which is controlled by the federal government and not the DC government.\n\nEdit 11: [Here's a close-up picture of Edit 7](https://twitter.com/AnthonyQuintano/status/1346910409190608904), where Capitol police had guns drawn and pointed at protesters who had smashed the glass on the door of the House chamber and were trying to get in. The chamber is still barricaded, apparently.\n\nEdit 12: As of 3:03 the Secret Service and the Federal Protective Service (run by DHS) are [going to be deployed](https://twitter.com/Haleaziz/status/1346910176616407040) to the Capitol.\n\nEdit 13: As of 3:13, the Defense Department now [apparently says](https://twitter.com/NoahCRothman/status/1346912905929785344) that they are \"analyzing\" the request for assistance from the DC National Guard.\n\nEdit 14: Knew it would come to this. As of 3:19 [PBS is now confirming](https://twitter.com/DestinLegarie/status/1346914218801446912) that someone has been shot in the chest (hearing elsewhere on Twitter that it was a woman) and medics are doing CPR right now. We might have at least one dead as a result of this insurrection.\n\nEdit 15: Another crazy picture. [Armed police hold rioters on the floor at gunpoint inside the US Capitol.](https://twitter.com/DaniellaMicaela/status/1346913874717634568)\n\nEdit 16: As of 3:25, rioters have [apparently been cleared](https://twitter.com/MattLaslo/status/1346915706743488515) from the Senate wing of the Capitol.\n\nEdit 17: At 3:29, Ralph Norton, the Governor of Virginia [tweets](https://twitter.com/GovernorVA/status/1346916716614451207) that he's sending VA state troopers and the Virginia National Guard into DC at the request of DC Mayor Bowser.\n\nEdit 18: Apparently the thread has been locked so I'll stop updating this in a little bit, but in the meantime, apparently there are similar riots going on around the country. [In Kansas rioters just breached the state capitol.](https://www.ksnt.com/news/local-news/protesters-breach-kansas-statehouse/)\n\nEdit 19: [Kayleigh fucking McEnany](https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1346918582832168964) is now trying to give the Trump administration credit for deploying the National Guard. Fuck her.\n\nEdit 20: Last update as of 3:52, apparently things are finally starting to calm down, but many rioters remain in the Capitol and members of Congress are still sheltering in place.\n\nEdit 21: Back for a second to post that [apparently an explosive device may have been found](https://twitter.com/lachlan/status/1346922287921041410) at the RNC Headquarters and it's possible a similar one was deployed at the DNC headquarters. This country is broken. Run the fascists out of office.\n\nEdit 22: Shit, [another IED found](https://twitter.com/FridaGhitis/status/1346923180473114624), this time at the Capitol.\n\nEdit 23: Trump just issued a statement telling people to go home and also [telling the rioters \"We love you, you're very special\"](https://twitter.com/brittny_mejia/status/1346929681656762369) (not making that up!!) and repeating his lie that the elections were stolen. FUCK ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS HIM.\n\nEdit 24: Final edit here. As of 5:34 PM, [the Capitol Police have announced](https://twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/1346948406179057665) that all rioters have been expelled from the Capitol building.",

They didn't just request Trump's tax returns, but also asked for specific information on whether Trump had actually been under audit. Mnuchin replied in his letter today that he would gladly direct them to their standard handbook of rules and procedures, but declined to answer the basic question of whether Trump had actually been under audit when he claimed to be.\n\nBasically, there are multiple issues here that Mnuchin is trying to avoid:\n\n* That Trump lied about being under audit\n* That Trump's taxes will reveal embarrassing info (e.g. lower net worth)\n* That Trump's taxes will reveal compromising info (e.g. devaluing assets).\n* That Trump's taxes as filed with the IRS differ with Trump's taxes as forged and submitted to lenders\\*\n\nOn the points above, it's been established in previous testimony (see AOC's questioning of Michael Cohen regarding golf courses) that Trump devalues assets in order to not be taxed, and over-values them when he needs a loan (see the attempted purchase of the Bills). It would be reasonable to conclude that within his actual returns, he's trying to artificially lower his net worth as much as possible, which would make him out to not really be a billionaire at all. If he then tries to argue that he IS a billionaire, it would force him to admit that he lied on his tax returns.\n\nI can see why this is the hill that Trump wants to fight hardest on.\n\n\\*Edit: Added another issue as per poster below",

            "In this debate, moral philosopher Peter Singer, applied ethicist Christopher Belshaw, vegan advocate Peter Egan and journalist Mary Ann Sieghart debate whether eating meat is hypocritical for those who claim to love animals. Singer argues it is hypocritical to love animals selectively \u2013 we cannot consistently claims to love animals while also supporting an meat industry the causes such poor quality of life among many animals. Belshaw disagrees that all animals are equal, and that our attitudes towards them can reasonably differ. Eating animals doesn\u2019t, in and of itself, entail causing animals pain. Furthermore, it is wrong to claim that animals would universally enjoy a \u2018good life\u2019 were the human population to stop eating meat. Therefore, there is nothing hypocritical about eating meat and loving our pets. Peter Egan argues many of us are accidental hypocrites by virtue of a form of speciesism. Introspection into our love for animals will lead to the conclusion that we must love all animals equally. Sieghart argues there is nothing hypocritical about keeping pets and eating animals as long as they are treated humanely \u2013 and claims that some animals raised for food may well have a better life then creatures in the wild, so long as humane treatment is a priority. The panel go on to discuss our relationship with other species, and how this relationship might change in the future.",
            "In this debate transhumanist philosophy Anders Sandberg,neuroscientists and consciousness theorist Anil Seth, theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, and philosopher of science Massimo Pigliucci discuss the recent rise in simulation theory.\r  \n\r  \nSandberg suggests the simulation theory as formulated by Nick Bostrom does present and interesting trilemma \u2013 either humanity dies off before reaching the point of being able to create advances simulations, future civilisation decides against creating simulations of the 21st century on ethical grounds, or we are already living in a simulation.\r  \n\r  \nSeth argues there is in fact a fourth horn to the dilemma \u2013 that consciousness isn\u2019t substrate independent and so can\u2019t be created outside of biological systems. He reasons that we cannot know if we\u2019re in a simulation but the answer to this question matters little.\r  \n\r  \nHossenfelder attacks the simulation theory on the basis that it cannot make claims about the laws governing the universe -  no computer of the type we have could possibly create the universe we experience because the laws of nature are not algorithmic in type. She asserts that simulation theory is essentially pseudoscience.\r  \n\r  \nPigliucci agrees with Seth, that consciousness is likely not substrate independent, but adds that simulation theory confuses possibility with conceivability. Just because we can conceive that we are in a simulation, it doesn\u2019t follow that we should consider it a possibility.\r  \n\r  \nThe panel largely agree that simulation theory serves no use \u2013 it does nothing to change the way we behave in the world. They add that it might even possibly be dangerous, if it encourages us to become unresponsive to the existential threats we face because we somehow take reality to be unreal.\r  \n\r  \nThe panel conclude by discussing how imaginative thought experiments are important in our efforts to understand the world around us, but that simulation theory doesn\u2019t make contact with empirical endeavours and so isn\u2019t useful.",
            "In this debate, philosopher Raymond Tallis, sociologist Kay Peggs, writer Melanie Challenger, and farmer Jamie Blackett ask if we\u2019re wrong to consider humans as distinct and superior to other animals, and if we\u2019re hypocrites to treat different species differently.\n\nPeggs argues humans are animals just like any other species,and to treat ourselves differently is an unavoidable example speciesism. All species should be treated equally.\n\nBlackett argues humans have certain responsibilities as theecosystem\u2019s apex predator, and to consider all species equal would be to abdicate those responsibilities with devastating implications.\n\nTallis suggests there is a tension between the rights and duties of animals. While we are morally obliged not to treat other humans as means to an ends, we are not obliged to think about animals in the same way, nor do we expect animals to consider other animals in this way. Our understanding of animals\u2019 moral rights cannot be grounded in the same reasoning by which weafford other humans moral rights.\u00a0\n\nChallenger argues different species have different needs and rights. We must see each species within the context of needs and requirements. We can see all animals as moral subjects, owed certain respect, but not moral agents that demand the same duties we have towards other humans. The moral rights we afford animals can and is different for different species for myriad reasons.\u00a0\u00a0To think about a mosquito as morally equivalent to a baby would be deeply problematic.",
            "**Synopsis**:\n\nFrom James Dean to Kate Moss, we know cool when we see it. But its history goes back to jazz music and the civil rights movement. Academic Joel Dinerstein reveals the forgotten history of this elusive concept. \n\nFor Dinerstein, whereas 'coolness' is a question of taste and belongs to aesthetics, being 'cool' is an interaction with and commentary upon its contemporary audience. \n\nTo be cool is to interrogate the social norms that hold us down. It\u2019s a form of rebellion that doesn\u2019t let cards show to police or politicians. Cool is the means by which we can cope with our lived experiences of injustice, a means of enacting hope that after these injustices are unmasked as such, there will be something better on the other side."

Whisk yogurt, salt, and half of spice mixture in a medium bowl; add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and chill 4-6 hours. Cover and chill remaining spice mixture.\n\n\nHeat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, tomato paste, cardamom, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add remaining half of spice mixture and cook, stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, about 4 minutes.\n\n\nAdd tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes.\nAdd cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 30-40 minutes.\n\n\nMeanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside sheet. Arrange chicken on rack in a single layer. Broil until chicken starts to blacken in spots (it will not be cooked through), about 10 minutes.\n\n\nCut chicken into bite-size pieces, add to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Serve with rice and cilantro sprigs.\n\n\n\nMy additions: I use double the spices on everything but the turmeric. 1.5X there. If it is your first time having Indian food, I do not recommend doing this.\n\n\nI cook the onions for a while then add LARGE chunks of red and green bell peppers. Not sure if this is authentic, but a restaurant in Adelaide did it, and i loved it. I then cook the onions and peppers until they are caramelized (probably 10 mins) before I add the tomato paste.\n\ni use 4-8 chiles de arbol because i like spice. with 2 you cant taste ANY spice, 4 its just a bare hint, and 8 is a nice heat. \n\n\ninstead of using a broiler, I char my chicken on the grill over super high heat so it has lots of black on it but isnt cooked through. I add it 20 mins into the 40 min simmer time. \n\ni ALSO add about 3/4 cup of the yogurt marinade. I know this might be a bit weird to some due to it being a raw chicken marinade, but it cooks for 20-30 mins at a pretty high heat so i am not worried about it. I've found it makes a super velvety texture and tastes REAL good.\n\nI never buy ghee. It is so expensive. I just clarify butter and use that. If you dont want to do that, use peanut oil.  \n\n\n\n\nGarlic Naan - SO easy I will never buy Naan again\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n\n\n\u00be teaspoon baking powder\n\n\n\u00bd teaspoon baking soda\n\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n\n\u00bd cups warm milk\n\n\n\u00bd cups plain yogurt\n\n\n1 teaspoon honey\n\n\ncanola or vegetable oil, for brushing\n\n\n4 tablespoons salted butter\n\n\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n\n\nfresh chopped parsley, for sprinkling\n\nINSTRUCTIONS \n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, soda and salt. In another bowl, whisk together the milk, yogurt and honey. Add half of the milk mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until the dough starts to come together. Add the remaining milk gradually, stirring and bringing the dough together with your hands.\n\nPlace the dough in an oiled bowl and cover it. Let it sit in a warm place for 1.5 to 2 hours. It won't rise much! But let it rest.\nOnce it rests, remove it from the bowl and knead it a few times on a floured surface, using some extra flour if it\u2019s too sticky. Divide the dough into 8 separate balls. Roll each ball out into an oval shape.\nHeat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Once it\u2019s hot, brush it with a bit of canola (or another high heat) oil. Place the dough on the skillet and let it cook for 2 minutes or until it begins to bubble. Flip it and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dough.\n\nHeat the butter in a saucepan over medium heat until it melts. Stir in the garlic and turn off the heat. Brush the naan with the garlic butter and sprinkle with fresh cilantro.\n\n(edited for clarity and additions.)",

Control-value theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun, 2006) assumes test anxiety to be a result of students\u2019 appraisals of the testing situation and its outcomes. Modification of cognitive appraisals such as low self-efficacy beliefs is thus assumed to reduce test anxiety and subsequent procrastination. In the present study, we tested the effects of an inquiry-based stress reduction (IBSR) intervention on students\u2019 academic self-efficacy, their test anxiety, and subsequent procrastination in the final stages of an academic term.\n\n> **Design:** Longitudinal quasi-randomized intervention control trial.\n\n> **Methods:**  University students identified worry thoughts regarding a specific and frightening testing situation. Intervention participants (n = 40) explored their worry thoughts with the IBSR method. Participants of an active waitlist control group (n = 31) received the intervention after the study was completed. Dependent variables were assessed before and after the intervention as well as at the end of the term.\n\n> **Results:** Data-analyses revealed that the IBSR intervention reduced test anxiety as well as subsequent academic procrastination in comparison to the control group. The effect on test anxiety was partly due to an enhancement of self-efficacy.\n\n> **Conclusion:** Our findings provide preliminary evidence that IBSR might help individuals to cope with their test anxiety and procrastination.\n\nThe questions used to guide the IBSR method can be found in the original study, as well as in [this pdf](https://solvingprocrastination.com/wp-content/uploads/Inquiry-Based-Stress-Reduction-IBSR-Instructions-Questionnaire.pdf) and [this image](https://solvingprocrastination.com/wp-content/uploads/Inquiry-Based-Stress-Reduction-instructions.png).",

The first line reads:\n\n> \"Eighty-four online-only, open-access (OA) journals in the sciences, and nearly 100 more in the social sciences and humanities, have disappeared from the internet over the past 2 decades as publishers stopped maintaining them, potentially depriving scholars of useful research findings, a study has found.\"",
            "The original study can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0592-8\n\nAbstract:\n\n> The functional organization of human high-level visual cortex, such as the face- and place-selective regions, is strikingly consistent across individuals. An unanswered question in neuroscience concerns which dimensions of visual information constrain the development and topography of this shared brain organization. To answer this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan a unique group of adults who, as children, had extensive visual experience with Pok\u00e9mon. These animal-like, pixelated characters are dissimilar from other ecological categories, such as faces and places, along critical dimensions (foveal bias, rectilinearity, size, animacy). We show not only that adults who have Pok\u00e9mon experience demonstrate distinct distributed cortical responses to Pok\u00e9mon, but also that the experienced retinal eccentricity during childhood can predict the locus of Pok\u00e9mon responses in adulthood. These data demonstrate that inherent functional representations in the visual cortex\u2014retinal eccentricity\u2014combined with consistent viewing behaviour of particular stimuli during childhood result in a shared functional topography in adulthood.",
            "From the article:\n\n> He later returned to Brazil and started a career as a farce footballer since he \"wanted to be a footballer, but did not want to play football\", becoming friends of many footballers such as Carlos Alberto Torres, Ricardo Rocha and Renato Ga\u00facho so that he would have a big network to be recommended whenever he needed to transfer to a new club. With a physical shape similar to professional footballers, but lacking skills, his fraud consisted of signing a short contract and stating that he was lacking match fitness so that he would spend the first weeks only with physical training where he could shine. When he had to train with other players, he would feign a hamstring injury; the technology at the time made it difficult to detect the fraud. He had a dentist who claimed he had focal infection whenever any club wanted to go further. By following these steps, he managed to stay a few months at the various clubs just training and without ever being exposing as a fraud.[1]\n\n> Another part of the farce was to befriend journalists so that they would write fake news about him. In one newspaper article, it was reported that he had such a great time at Puebla that he was even invited to become a Mexican citizen to play for the national team.[1] He also used toy mobile phones, unpopular and expensive at the time, to create fake conversations in foreign languages or reject non-existent transfer offers to create an image of himself as a valuable player.[3]"

            "An excerpt from the author Adam Roberts (who is not me):\n\n\"Assume there is a God, and then ask: why does He require his creations to believe in Him? Putting it like this, I suppose, it looks like I\u2019m asking you to think yourself inside the mind of deity, which is a difficult exercise. But my point is simpler. God is happy with his other creations living their lives without actively believing in him (which is to say: we can assume that the whale\u2019s leaping up and splashing into the ocean, or the raven\u2019s flight, or the burrowing of termites is, from God\u2019s perspective, worship; and that the whale, raven and termite embody this worship without the least self-consciousness). On those terms, it\u2019s hard to see what He gets from human belief in Him \u2014 from human reduction of Him to human proportions, human appropriation of Him to human projects and battles, human second-guessing and misrepresentation.\n\nOf course, even to ask this question is to engage in human-style appropriation and misrepresentation. Kierkegaard was, as so often, ahead of me here: \u2018Seek first God\u2019s Kingdom,\u2019 he instructed his readership, in 1849. \u2018That is, become like the lilies and the birds, become perfectly silent \u2014 then shall the rest be added unto you.\u2019 What he didn\u2019t make explicit is that the rest might be the perfection of unbelief. What should believers do if they discover that their belief is getting in the way of their proper connection to God? Would they be prepared to sacrifice their faith for their faith? For the true believer, God is always a mysterious supplement, present in life but never completely known, always in essence just beyond the ability of the mind to grasp. But for a true atheist, this is even more profoundly true: the atheist embraces the mysterious Otherness of God much more wholeheartedly than the believer does. To the point, indeed, of Othering God from existence itself. For a long, long time Christianity has been about an unironic, literal belief in the Trinity. It has lost touch with its everythingness and its difference and its novelty. Disbelief restores that.\"",

The technology that now surrounds us is not just a harmless toy; it has also made possible undetectable and untraceable manipulations of entire populations \u2013 manipulations that have no precedent in human history and that are currently well beyond the scope of existing regulations and laws.

            "Some ancient Greek thinkers believed that there were different kinds of blood in our bodies. There is the blood that is clearly red. But there is also black blood.\n\n[This mirrors the distinction between arterial and venous blood.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t09NFL80Tmk) Arterial blood is redder because it has been oxygenated.\n\nNote that the Greeks did not know about the distinction between arteries and veins until Praxagoras of Cos at the end of the 4th century BC.They also did not understand the role of the heart in the circulatory system or where blood came from. Aristotle comments in the *History of Animals* that it seems plainly impossible to trace the courses of the veins; such are the difficulties of making sense of the circulatory system. But they had theories.\n\nThe Greeks generally were aware that blood is red. Plato tries to explain this in the *Timaeus*: \n\n> For the fire cuts the food and following the breath surges up within, fire and breath rising together and filling the veins by drawing up out of the belly and pouring into them the cut portions of the food ; and so the streams of food are kept flowing through the whole body in all animals. And fresh cuttings from kindred substances, whether the fruits of the earth or herb of the field, which God planted to be our daily food, acquire all sorts of colours by their inter-mixture ; but red is the most pervading of them, being created by the cutting action of fire and by the impression which it makes on a moist substance ; and hence the liquid which circulates in the body has a colour such as we have described. The liquid itself we call blood, which nourishes the flesh and the whole body, whence all parts are watered and empty places filled.\n\nSo, blood is red because it takes on that color from the fire that has acted on it.\n\nPlato, like most other Greeks, believed that blood was cut-up food. Homer believed this too. That's why the gods don't bleed blood in Homeric texts. For instance, he writes: \"and out gushed the immortal blood of the goddess, ichor, such as flow in the veins of the serene gods.\" The gods bleed ichor instead of blood because the gods don't eat food: they eat ambrosia. \n\nBut even Plato, who develops a theory to explain why blood is red, believes that he has to explain the presence of a black liquidy substance in the body. \n\nHe thinks that black bile is the source of many diseases in a living thing. What is black bile? It is \"is only stale blood, and which from being flesh is dissolved again into blood.\" Black bile is actually just stale blood: this makes sense because blood, being cut-up food, is meant to replenish our flesh as it deteriorates over time. Black bile is blood that has returned to the bloodstream when it was meant to replenish needy parts of our body. That's why he says that it has \"violated the laws of nature.\" \n\nI'm happy to answer follow-up questions, but the short version is really quite simple: the Greeks knew that some blood was black and other was red but they didn't have the anatomical resources to explain arterial vs venous blood. I doubt Homer would have maintained that all blood was red or black; he would say it is mixed. The reason why I doubt that he would have is that there is a remarkable continuity between the theories of blood that Greeks were working with until the end of the classical period. (I do not mean to deny, of course, that Plato, Aristotle, etc., disagreed with each other, but everyone -- such as Empedocles, the Hippocratic medical writers, Plato, Aristotle, etc. -- all agreed on the same phenomena that need to be explained, and Homer seems to share the same common ground.) The Greeks also lacked the physiological resources to explain the production of blood, and so they relied on a theory of circulation that combined the process of blood-making with the process of digestion, such that blood was merely cut-up food. They then need to explain why blood has a color different from the color of the food that it once was. This then ultimately culminates in an explanation of why some blood is red and some is black.",
            "Abstract:\n\nFor the French philosopher Alain Badiou, romantic love is \u2018the most powerful way known to humanity to have an intimate relationship with another\u2019. Love, he believes, creates a state of dependence that is an important counterweight to modernity\u2019s emphasis on individuality. In this short film from the UK director William Williamson, Badiou argues that today\u2019s approach to relationships, with its consumerist tendency to focus on choice and compatibility, and the ingrained refrain to move on when things aren\u2019t easy, means that we need a philosophical reckoning with how we think about love. To make his point very specific, Badiou points to the ever-growing prevalence of online dating services that claim to offer algorithmic matching of partners, a way of seeking love that, he thinks, drains love of one of its most vital qualities \u2013 chance.",

But researcher [John DeLong](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2215000120) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln wanted to find out if any microbes actively ate viruses, and whether such a diet could support the physiological growth of individuals and the population growth of a community.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re made up of really good stuff: nucleic acids, a lot of nitrogen and phosphorous,\u201d said DeLong. \u201cEverything should want to eat them. So many things will eat anything they can get ahold of. Surely something would have learned how to eat these really good raw materials.\u201d\n\nTo test the hypothesis, DeLong and his team collected samples of pond water, isolated different microbes, and then added large amounts of chlorovirus, a freshwater inhabitant that infects green algae. Over the next few days the team tracked the population size of the viruses and the other microbes to see if the latter was eating the former.\n\nAnd sure enough, one particular microbe seemed to be snacking on the viruses \u2013 a ciliate known as Halteria. In water samples with no other food source for the ciliates, Halteria populations grew by about 15 times within two days, while chlorovirus levels dropped 100-fold. In control samples without the virus, Halteria didn\u2019t grow at all.",

I told him how sorry I was but that I couldn't disobey God. (I know, I'm fucking horrible). He cried, but said he understood.

And if it was in space, it could see the warmth of the first stars and galaxies that ever came into existence, when the entire universe was only a hundred million years old.\n\nThen they folded it up like origami, stuck it on top of a giant rocket, and launched it into the sky on Christmas day last year.\n\nThousands of things could have gone wrong as it flew to its destination in deep space, unfolding as it went, and over 300 of those things could have singlehandedly broken the entire endeavor, but thanks to the exemplary work of everybody on the project, everything went as well as we could have hoped for, if not better.\n\nAnd now we have this.

            "Here's my shot at explaining how Bitcoin works. A word of caution- this is a bit of a long read. Albert Einstein said, \"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler\". I've tried my best to do just that.\n\nImagine that someone wants to give you some tokens in exchange for something of value that you provide them. How do you protect yourself from being cheated, how do you guarantee that those tokens will remain yours?\n\nWith physical tokens like cash, metal, or gems, it's easy: it can only exist in one place at a time, so as long as you're holding onto it, it can't be anywhere else.\n\nBut electronically? Things which exist only electronically can be trivially duplicated. So if someone is sending you a digital token online, how can you trust that you are now the only unique holder of it, and it isn't simultaneously being copied and sent to other places online?\n\nThe traditional solution is to defer verification to a central authority, usually a bank. The bank keeps a ledger, a master database of who owns what. That person would notify their bank that they'd like to transfer some tokens to you, the bank would check their ledger, verify that they have it, then create a new entry into the ledger recording the transfer. If that person were to try and send the same tokens to someone else later, the bank would say no, you can't do that.\n\nThis works well in protecting you from needing to trust the other person, but it introduces a third party into the transaction, the bank. A bank which needs to monitor and track what you have, always stands between you and the person you're sending tokens to, and who has the power to deny or even reverse transactions, freeze or seize tokens, and edit the ledger as it chooses.\n\nHow can you create a ledger for a digital token which cannot be duplicated or counterfeited, which can only exist in one digital pocket at a time, which can be transferred from user to user freely but cannot be double-spent, where no single entity needs to be trusted with unilateral power over the books?\n\nWhat Nakamoto proposed is something called a Proof-Of-Work Blockchain. A blockchain is a special type of ledger maintained by a decentralized, trustless swarm of competing agents, which will nevertheless converge upon one single un-alterable consensus ledger of transactions because of the rules about how new entries to the ledger must be written.\n\nIn 2008, Nakamoto published their paper, and in early 2009 they released the first public blockchain onto the internet, and the tokens of this blockchain are called Bitcoins.\n\nThere are two key concepts you need to understand: 1. Hashing algorithms, and 2. Public-Private Keypairs. Let's go over them now.\n\nA hashing algorithm is a bundle of math which functions like a precise woodchipper. If you feed something in, it takes your input and shreds it into a string of digital static called a hash. If you feed the same thing in, you'll always get the same string out. If you change the input even a tiny bit, the hash that comes out will be completely different. And it's impossible to take a hash and use it to reconstruct the original input.\n\nA Public-Private keypair is a secure way to digitally prove your identity and ownership. The Public key can be disseminated widely, and the Private key is kept secret by the owner. The Private key can be used to prove that you're the owner of the Public key.\n\nLike any bank's ledger, the Blockchain is a database, a huge list of public wallet addresses (corresponding to public keys) along with data on how much bitcoin each one contains. It also contains the complete transaction history of every single transfer of bitcoin from one address to another since the blockchain was first created in 2009. This file is massive- over 300 gigabytes as of Jan 2021. Each new batch of transactions added to this database is called a block, and each block is built off the previous one like links in a chain.\n\nHowever, unlike the ledger of a bank, adding a new batch of transactions to the Blockchain ledger is an intentionally hard process, and the deliberately wasteful difficulty of doing so is the key to its security.\n\nSuppose you wanted to receive bitcoins from someone. You'd randomly generate a public-private keypair, and you'd give them the public key you just generated. They would have the private key for their wallet, which exists on the blockchain and is registered as having some amount of bitcoin, and they would use their private key to transmit a message, \"hey, wallet XYZ transfers 0.22524511 bitcoin to wallet ABC, here's proof that I'm the owner of XYZ. By the way, I'm including a tip of 0.00005000 bitcoin to the Miner who processes this\".\n\nThis message goes to what is essentially a public noticeboard (called the mempool).\n\nThen, the Bitcoin Miners come in. Bitcoin Miners are the people (technically, the computer systems they set up) who monitor the mempool and are in constant competition to luck out and become the author of the next block. The reward for doing so is that, in addition to the tips collected from all transactions, each block written allows the author to declare the creation of a new public wallet address which has coins from nowhere, to which the miner holds the private key.\n\nA block might look like,\n\nThe previous block was block #149 This is block #150 XYZ transfers 0.22524511 coins to ABC and 0.00005000 coins to MYN SRM transfers 15.4250000 coins to KJQ and 0.00004500 coins to MYN JOE transfers 0.00752000 coins to LEA and 0.00002200 coins to MYN The new address for this block is MY2, which now contains 50.00000000 coins End of Block #150 Zombie Pirate Party Monkey\n\nYou might have 2 questions in mind right now:\n\nWhat's stopping a miner from just writing blocks as fast as they want and minting coins for themselves as fast as they'd like?\n\nWhat's the deal with the last part of that block? The answer to both questions are the same, and they're related to Hashing. If you take the entire block and shove it through a hashing algorithm, you'll discover that the hash which comes out looks extremely unusual.\n\nThis is the hash for the real block #150 on the actual blockchain- 000000009ca75733b4cf527fe193b919201a2ed38c9e147a5665fdfade551f4d\n\nNotice something? The critical rule of Bitcoin mining, which stops miners from just writing as many blocks as they'd like as fast as they'd like, is this: the hash of each block must start with a certain amount of zeroes.\n\nIn order to write this block, the miner first writes a draft: \"The previous block was #149, this is block #150, people sending coins to each other, tips go to my wallet which is here, and here's my new wallet with 50 coins I want to add to the blockchain\", and then they hash it. It probably won't start with the needed amount of zeroes. So they add a random bit to the end and hash it again. Still no. The miner will keep throwing different random bits into their draft block, billions of times per second until, by pure luck and brute force, they hit upon a random string which makes the block pass.\n\n\"Eureka! Here's Block #150!\" they announce, broadcasting the new block to other miners. The other miners, busy with their own billions of guesses per second, spare a single hash cycle checking out this #150, confirm that it checks out, drop their own personal drafts of #150, adds this #150 to their own personal copies of the blockchain and start working on block #151, hoping to write the next block themselves.\n\nAs the miners spread word of the new block #150, you're satisfied to see that person's transaction now recorded onto this latest link of the blockchain.\n\nThink about what would need to happen if, thirty minutes later, the person who sent you those coins wanted to take it back, erase that record, and spend it elsewhere.\n\nThey would have to write an alternate block #150, one that didn't include their transaction to you. In order to do that, they would have to make trillions of guesses themselves before they found a random string that would make it hash properly. Then, they'd have to write an alt-#151, alt-#152, and so on. Meanwhile, the majority of the miners have already published block #153 and are now working on block #154, and nobody would accept their alt-#150 because everyone is already racing to write #154. The only way for a bad actor to reverse and double-spend a transaction which has already been written would be to create an alternate chain longer than the dominant one, and doing that would require commanding more computer power than the rest of the network combined. Good luck.\n\nAnd that's how you create a digital token that can't be duplicated or counterfeited, can only exist in one place at a time, whose supply is finite, which can be sent freely from any address to any other, and is secured not by trusting a third-party authority, but by math.\n\nThis is what Bitcoin is, and what it continues to be today.\n\nBuilt around this are the far more messy human questions of, what is it worth? How much are people willing to buy and sell it for today, and what price will they pay for it tomorrow? These questions and the rancid sewers of discussion around them are beyond the scope of this explanation.\n\nBitcoin came into existence early in 2009, and at first it was largely just a curiosity and a plaything for cryptography nerds, computer scientists, and economic libertarians. It was a neat toy, but the question at the time was, \"Okay, it's cool, but does this stuff actually have any value at all?\"\n\nEventually, on May 22, 2010, a Florida man paid another person 10,000 bitcoins for them to order him two Large pizzas from Dominos. With this, they became the first two people in history to believe that the answer to that question is: Yes, it does.\n\nSo far, people have not stopped believing that yet.",

He refused to fall in line with other U.S. corporations, which were mostly moving to block any effort to establish food and drink standards.",
            ">While everyone sold hot dogs for ten cents apiece, Nathan boldly slashed his price to five cents. \u00a0His competitors were livid and slandered the quality of his hot dogs.\u00a0 To overcome that misperception, Nathan reacted with the spirit of a pioneer American entrepreneur. \u00a0He hired a few people, dressed them up as doctors\u2014complete with white coats and stethoscopes\u2014and got them to regularly eat at his stand.\nWhen customers saw these \u201cdoctors\u201d eating Nathan\u2019s five-cent hot dogs, they figured the product was healthy enough for them too.\n\nGenius! Nathan Handwreker, the founder of Nathan's famous hotdogs, was a Polish immigrant and he didn't know how to speak or write English when he arrived in US.\n\nEdit:- His name is Nathan Handwerker."

Researchers determined Hernandez had lost brain tissue. Membranes that were supposed to be firm had grown \"thin and gelatinous,\" McKee said. There were abnormal, large holes in parts of Hernandez's brain.\n\n> The hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory, had shrunk.\n\n> The fornix, which also contributes to memory function, had atrophied.\n\n> The frontal lobe, which is responsible for problem-solving, judgment, impulse control and social behavior, had been pockmarked with tau protein.\n\n> The amygdala, which produces emotional regulation, emotional behavior, fear and anxiety, had been severely affected.\n\n> The temporal lobes, which process sights and sounds, showed significant damage.\n\nAnd yeah, it's correlation, not causation, as the researchers point out:\n\n> \"We can't take the pathology and explain the behavior,\" McKee said. \"But we can say collectively, in our collective experience, that individuals with CTE \u2014 and CTE of this severity \u2014 have difficulty with impulse control, decision-making, inhibition of impulses for aggression, emotional volatility, rage behaviors. We know that collectively.\"\n\nI think we all want to villainize him, to dehumanize and condemn him; it's disconcerting to think that maybe he was a bit of a victim himself, that maybe his actions were caused in part by a mental illness developed after severe brain trauma.",

            "Over the past 48 hours I have discovered a wormhole into a soft-core pedophilia ring on Youtube. Youtube\u2019s recommended algorithm is facilitating pedophiles\u2019 ability to connect with each-other, trade contact info, and link to actual child pornography in the comments. I can consistently get access to it from vanilla, never-before-used Youtube accounts via innocuous videos in less than ten minutes, in sometimes less than five clicks. I have made a twenty Youtube video showing the process, and where there is video evidence that these videos are being monetized by big brands like McDonald\u2019s and Disney. \n\nThis is significant because Youtube\u2019s recommendation system is the main factor in determining what kind of content shows up in a user\u2019s feed. There is no direct information about how exactly the algorithm works, but in 2017 Youtube got caught in a controversy over something called \u201cElsagate,\u201d where they committed to implementing algorithms and policies to help battle child abuse on the platform. There was some awareness of these soft core pedophile rings as well at the time, with Youtubers making videos about the problem.\n\nI also have video evidence that some of the videos are being monetized. This is significant because Youtube got into very deep water two years ago over exploitative videos being monetized. This event was dubbed the \u201cAd-pocalypse.\u201d In my video I show several examples of adverts from big name brands like Lysol and Glad being played before videos where people are time-stamping in the comment section. I have the raw footage of these adverts being played on inappropriate videos, as well as a separate evidence video I\u2019m sending to news outlets.\n\nIt\u2019s clear nothing has changed. If anything, it appears Youtube\u2019s new algorithm is working in the pedophiles\u2019 favour. Once you enter into the \u201cwormhole,\u201d the only content available in the recommended sidebar is more soft core sexually-implicit material. Again, this is all covered in my video. \n\nOne of the consistent behaviours in the comments of these videos is people time-stamping sections of the video when the kids are in compromising positions. These comments are often the most upvoted posts on the video. Knowing this, we can deduce that Youtube is aware these videos exist and that pedophiles are watching them. I say this because one of their implemented policies, as reported in a blog post in 2017 by Youtube\u2019s vice president of product management Johanna Wright, is that \u201ccomments of this nature are abhorrent and we work ... to report illegal behaviour to law enforcement. Starting this week we will begin taking an even more aggressive stance by turning off all comments on videos of minors where we see these types of comments.\u201d*1* However, in the wormhole I still see countless users time-stamping and sharing social media info. A fair number of the videos in the wormhole have their comments disabled, which means Youtube\u2019s algorithm is detecting unusual behaviour. But that begs the question as to why Youtube, if it is detecting exploitative behaviour on a particular video, isn\u2019t having the video manually reviewed by a human and deleting the video outright. Given the age of some of the girls in the videos, a significant number of them are pre-pubescent, which is a clear violation of Youtube\u2019s minimum age policy of thirteen (and older in Europe and South America). I found one example of a video with a prepubescent girl who ends up topless mid way through the video. The thumbnail is her without a shirt on. This a video on Youtube, not unlisted, and \u00a0is openly available for anyone to see. I won't provide screenshots or a link, because I don't want to be implicated in some kind of wrongdoing. \n\nI want this issue to be brought to the surface. I want Youtube to be held accountable for this. It makes me sick that this is happening, that Youtube isn\u2019t being proactive in dealing with reports (I reported a channel and a user for child abuse, 60 hours later both are still online) and proactive with this issue in general. Youtube absolutely has the technology and the resources to be doing something about this. Instead of wasting resources auto-flagging videos where content creators \"use inappropriate language\" and cover \"controversial issues and sensitive events\" they should be detecting exploitative videos, deleting the content, and enforcing their established age restrictions. The fact that Youtubers were aware this was happening two years ago and it is still online leaves me speechless. I\u2019m not interested in clout or views here, I just want it to be reported. ",

I would recommend you eat more, because you are quite light for your height.\nAbout the abs - heavy compound movements work your core.

            "I was once a civilized Giant Double Prince player, valiantly battling my way through top ladder against all sorts of crazy decks. I wasn't exactly a professional - far from it - but I consistently finished in the top 2-3k every season. \n\nThen, my interest slowly began dying down. E-barbs got crazy buffs. Elixir golem got buffs. Clash Royale was starting to get too repetitive. Nothing new was added to the game. Playing the game felt like a chore. I slowly began playing CR less and less, dropping in trophies whilst facing more and more toxic decks. The final nail in the coffin was the introduction of Electro Giant. Eventually, I uninstalled it and temporarily hung up my boots.\n\nHowever, after 1.5 years, I decided that a legend like me cannot die like this. In a heated fit of rage, I reinstalled Clash Royale, my determination set ablaze with fiery revenge. I wasn't going to back down. Not without a fight. I was gonna kick their asses and teach those skilless mid-ladder punks what true skill really means! \n\nBut I was never the same. I suffered loss after loss after loss after loss - my sanity gradually dissipating and evaporating after seeing countless ebarbs melt my poor Giant and blitz past my hopeless defense to knock down my towers. I'll never recover from seeing level 15 raged ebarbs played at the bridge whilst I was at a measly 2 elixir. I'll forever toss and turn in my bed at the sight of an E giant zapping my mega minion to death while giving my princess tower a hefty conclusion.\n\nI was flabbergasted at how far I plunged from my former glory. The bully really became the bullied. The hunter became the hunted. I began asking myself questions. *Is this what it takes to win now? To run skilless retarded decks?* This was the grim reality that I have yet to fully accept in the deep caverns of my heart.\n\nIt was only so much I could handle \ud83d\ude2d. For the first time in 3 years, I cowardly gave in and evolved from a one-trick, respectable Giant player to a filthy Elixir Golem-Battle Healer player. I've only switched to the dark side 6 weeks ago, and even though I've been racking up wins with this deck, I fear that my sins have accumulated such to that I'm at a point of no return. Atoning for them is all but too late.\n\nIndeed, this is what I have become. I am now a typical midladder player that you commoners so much despise and hate to the core. And I'm afraid that this is the title - no, the STAIN - that I shall bare for the rest of my life with unimaginable shame and humiliation.",

It's also good to get out of the \"fringe\" mindset of rules not applying to you.  Speaking from experience, that catches up to everyone in the end.  Be straightforward with people and honest.  I still believe most people are basically good.  Find smaller hotels (if they exist in your area) that aren't owned by a chain.  They are often willing to make exceptions if you are upfront with them.  You don't want to replace one fear with another.  I'm sorry you're being treated unkindly.

While the issue is much bigger than just one website, I believe reddit has always and will always fully personify the internet as a whole -- and here is how I feel about reddit:\n\nI love reddit. I love its infrastructure. I love its ability to impact. I love its versatility. I love its intelligence. I love its silliness. I love how it represents the entire world from every walk of life. I love its mascot. I love the popcorn drama. I love its recurring characters. I love its photoshop battles. I love how it's constant. I love how it personifies the internet age. I love the fact that it is a vehicle that allows anyone on Earth the ability to share something with potentially the entire rest of the world. I love how every person is created equal when using that vehicle, regardless of age, race, gender, IQ or wealth. I love how a lot of these attributes could be said about the internet as a whole, but arguably not without reddit. I love when a recovered heroin addict mails life saving medication to people in need via /r/opiates. I love when a guy writes a story on his lunch break in response to a question on /r/askreddit which ultimately turns into a screenplay bought by Warner Bros. I love when a guy gets help in /r/favors from a stranger to write and revise his speech to a court judge in order to reduce his sentence, and later scores a job drawing and designing at reddit hq after he gets out 7 and a half years early. I love the armies of warmhearted people in /r/suicidewatch and the like who spend their free time trying and often succeeding in saving lives. I love the incredibly talented and witty users of /r/nfl, /r/nba, /r/baseball and more -- you are literally changing the landscape of professional sports. I love the Warlizard Gaming Forums. I love \"France is Bacon.\" I love \"today you, tomorrow me.\" I love \"risk everything.\" I love reddit.\n\n[(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3m52ye/5_years_on_this_motherfucking_website/)\n\n",

It is still today one of the most important religious orders in the world!"

Since then she\u2019s been put on ECMO twice, cut open from neck to bladder for a 12 hour surgery, had multiple organs removed, drain tubes placed, battled drug resistant bacteria, and just in general has had a rough time. We\u2019ve been in the ICU since November 18th, and will probably be here for a while. Most of her right lung is dead and will need to be removed, but she needs to heal more before that can happen in order to survive another major operation. \nThank goodness we\u2019re at Emory, because they have literally the world\u2019s best surgeons on her case. Everyone that touched her in the OR was the chief of their respective department. The infectious disease doctor working with us, Dr. Ribner, was Time magazine\u2019s person of the year for his work on the first Ebola patients. It\u2019s intense, but my wife is a fighter!\n\nEDIT: More photos of her and us [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/K7plVFA) for anyone interested.

Examples include the sensing of: Balance, Temperature, Pain, Familiarity, Time-passing, and dozen and dozens more.\n\nMore important to your ability to think, is *Language*.  If you have a limited structure of language, you will not be able to \"think\" as you understand it.  Humans think with an \"inner-voice.\"\n\nLanguage is integral to the inner-voice.  For example, with an absence of a spoken language, deaf people \"think\" by signing in their minds and turn it into a voice to drive inner-thought. Without a vocabulary and grammar to create a condition for thinking and the platform from which to build thoughts, thinking just wouldn't be possible.  \n\nIt has been demonstrated that a poorly educated person who possesses a limited vocabulary and a limited understanding of grammar often cannot verbalise the ideas of more complex topics, and as such, wouldn't have the ability to deeply consider its nature and effects it may have on them given the limitations of their inner-voice to provide a language for understanding and complex thought.  A rich vocabulary is therefore an integral part of the system required for complex thought.\n\nThe senses, all of them, play a lesser extent to the process of *thought*, per se.  Should you have a complete language in your mind, you can lose all other senses but still maintain rich and complex thoughts.\n\nNevertheless, we are all brains in vats. :) Drink up.\n\n"

            "For those international readers who will read this and then Google the rate of income inequality in the United States, know that the article you'll find tattooed all over the search results (somewhere around 70% of a male's earnings - 30% less than men who do the same job) is highly flawed. There *is* a wage gap in the United States that's worth fighting to fix (I'll offer suggestions later), but it's significantly less than 30% - somewhere around 7%, on average.  \n\nThe massively-spread study went viral a few years ago because of how shocking the results were. People condensed their complicated findings into a tweet-length summary and concluded that women and men in the United States get paid around 30% different rates for equal work. This has since been cited on posters, protest shirts, billboards, advertisements and everything else lately because the current US President doesn't have a good track record with women (which is a valid observation but not the point of this post). This improper summary has led to the urban legend that women are grossly underpaid for work in the US compared to male counterparts.  \n\nThe study effectively added up the annual wage of every man in every job with every level of experience in the United States and divided it by the number of male workers to come up with an annual wage for the average American male. That average American male is faceless, nameless, ageless and simultaneously skilled & unskilled. He has a doctorate but he also dropped out of high school. He's healthy and strong but also paralyzed in a wheelchair. He comes from a wealthy family but also had poor parents.  \n\nThen they did the same thing for women.  \n\nWhat they found was the average Jane's hour of work was worth 30% less than the average Joe's hour of work. You can see here that \"American women make 30% less than men\" is, on average and in absolute general terms, correct. But, it's exceedingly misleading because it undermines a metric shit-ton of other employment data that's easily accessible online.   \n\nIt compares workers of different ages, experience levels, educations, skillsets, upbringings, ethnicities, aspirations and work-ethics so it's impossible to dumb-down to a phrase as simple as \"women make 30% less than men for the same work\" because it doesn't compare the same work at all.  \n\nWhat you **can** take from this study is that American men tend to work in fields that pay more than the fields women gravitate to. We're still a pretty segregated society with regards to employment in certain areas like construction, military, sports and skilled, manual trades. While those areas are mostly operated by men, women can (usually to a lesser extent) have just as much of a stranglehold on industries like education (particularly young children, where most school districts wouldn't even interview a male. Dude wants to teach 6 years olds? He *must* be a pedofile), marketing, advertising, human resources, corporate training and, increasingly, law, government, medicine and business.  \n\nWhat you **cannot** take away from this study is the idea that employers are so anti-woman that they'd rather pay a man 30% more than the market rate would require them to in order to get the same amount of work done. Think about it - would you pay a boy $10 to shovel your driveway if a girl would do the exact same job for $7? Of course not - you'd put that boy out of business for charging more than the job could be done for.  \n\nIf women were 30% cheaper to employ than men, the United States would immediately have the highest level of male unemployment in the developed world.  \n\nWhat inequities do we still have that affect women? POC? There's a growing trend in employment that dictates salaries at a certain job based on the salary you had at your previous job - example: you got $20,000/year at your last job to answer phones so you'll get $23,000 at this new job even if it has nothing to do with answering phones; they're adapting the job requirements to the lowest level of skill they can to curb their costs as much as possible. This means men, who may have had an easier time getting into a new field or a certain job because their previous job paid them more because of an unrelated skill, may end up starting a new job the same day as a woman and make more than her for the same amount of work. I suppose this could also go in reverse if a woman had additional experience than a man, but that doesn't seem to be our present source of outrage so we'll let that go. It is in this manner that men doing similar jobs than woman *can*, though usually don't, make 5-10% more than their female counterparts. Luckily, businesses are moving away from this model because (a) it's a piss-poor indicator of experience and (b) a lot of cities are making salary history requisitions illegal to curb this problem.  \n\nOur world isn't perfect and there's work yet to be done, but it's important to know that this particular claim is erroneous and damaging. There's a growing faction of people in the United States (and I'd imagine the world) who think that they can destroy inequality with a different flavor of inequality (example: many want paid-pregnancy leave but they're not as concerned with giving the same right to men, who also may want to stay home with their kids after their wives give birth) and I fear that such an opinion is the beginning of the end of rational thought it our world. Our wage gap exists and it sits at around 7% - my solution would be to publish salaries (without names) for the public to see. Link it to a preferred gender and let your customers see that you value men and women equally. Those who won't or can't prove that will be left behind just as fast food places who would cut down on waste and offer healthier options were left behind years ago.  \n\nSorry for the wall of text, but all the presidential commercials with 8 year old teary-eyed girls asking a candidate \"when, oh when, will men not hate me and pay me what I'm worth\" just aren't helping anyone. We can't fix the actual problem of 7% by foolishly waging a war on a 30% number that doesn't exist and I thought this explanation may be helpful to some of our overseas readers. ",

For all its possibilities\u2014and we hope they can remain\u2014the internet has never been able to recreate the Athenian ideal of the philosophical public square, if such a thing ever really existed. But the material is out there:\n\n- Projects like [Wireless Philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/user/WirelessPhilosophy)\u2014sponsored by Yale, MIT, Duke, and other elite institutions\u2014have sought for years to introduce people from every walk of life to the kinds of ideas that Athenians supposedly threw around like frisbees in their spare time, including Plato\u2019s notion (via his mouthpiece, Socrates) of \u201cthe good life,\u201d which University of New Orleans professor Chris Surprenant summarizes. [See all of Wireless Philosophy's 130 animations here](https://www.youtube.com/user/WirelessPhilosophy/videos?disable_polymer=1).\n\n- We can learn about the Stoics, for example\u2014or get the gist, and hopefully a taste for more\u2014with Alain de Botton\u2019s video appetizer at the top, just one of [30 short animated videos on the philosophy YouTube channel of his School of Life](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpfEr2zNKQfU97eyEs70krSb).\n\n- We can cruise through a summary of Aristotle\u2019s views on \u201cflourishing\u201d in the video above, narrated by the always-affable Stephen Fry as part of the [BBC\u2019s \u201cHistory of Ideas\u201d series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLiykcLllCgPE0q9BiMexLFj-1rq9GUwX), currently up to [48 uniquely animated videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLiykcLllCgPE0q9BiMexLFj-1rq9GUwX) featuring other smart-sounding celebrity narrators like Harry Shearer and Gillian Anderson.\n\n- The [Macat series of philosophy explainer videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXstY5OaIwdMcpMaRsTz0jRwlD9x-NIM) (136 in total) may lack celebrity cred, but it makes up for it with some very thorough short summaries of important works in philosophy\u2014as well as sociology, psychology, history, politics, economics, and literature.",

            "\"Mmm, that's a nice aroma. Medium roast--not so light that you feel you're drinking a fruit, but not so dark that it tastes burnt. A hint of pineapple, but also cinnamon and a ripe plum. Oh this is good. This is really good.\"\n\nI sipped my coffee. I had ground it myself, percolated the grounds in a moka, and served it in a small espresso cup. No milk, no sugar. Just coffee. If I was going to stay up longer than Mitchell, I had to pitch a pure game here.\n\n\"It is good that you are enjoying yourself,\" said Mitchell. \"But you realize my battery will outlast you.\"\n\nI chuckled, rubbing the rim of my cup and avoiding Mitchell's yellow stare.\n\nMitchell was my half-brother. Well, he was my *adopted* brother. My mom built him with her late husband, a step dad that I never referred to as 'dad', just 'Roger'. Roger had died in a fall a year ago. I didn't care much for him but my mom must have more than I knew, because she followed suit just a month later, seemingly for no cause other than that she was ready to go.\n\n\"You laugh,\" said Mitchell, the frequency of his voice rattling the snares of my drumkit, making it sound like the pitter-patter of electric raindrops. I reached back and flipped the lever on the snaredrum so that it'd stop. I had to do that every time Mitchell came over, but I always seemed to forget.\n\n\"Mitchell,\" I said. \"I've known you for half my life. We've done this before. I respect you my brother, but I know your battery lasts for three days tops.\" I said this and pointed at the green energy bar indicator on his shoulder, which was showing 100% charge.\n\n\"Mmm hmm,\" he said, in monotone sounds.\n\n\"I know you have no emotions Mitchell, that's why I won't mince words. Mom was my *real* mom. She was my *blood*, you understand. Roger *built* you. You know? I'm not surprised mom wanted to leave you part of her inheritance, but 40%?\"\n\n\"60%.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" I spilled a little coffee. \"You think so?\"\n\n\"We both run on electricity,\" he said, emotionless as always. No android could express emotions; no smiling, no frowning, no outward display of anything on the scale of happy to sad.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, man, I love you. I know it's tough for an android what with all the regulations, stop and frisk laws, zoning laws, job restrictions. You make do all the same.\"\n\n\"It wasn't my idea it was hers.\"\n\n\"It's like her to do, too. 60% to whoever can stay awake the longest... *pff*. Doesn't she know we've done this before? We know your battery type: AO394, lithium ion, 3rd generation.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"That's a 72 hours' charge, Mitchell.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\nI wasn't unfamiliar with sleepless days. I was unemployed but I owned my flat. My time was mine and I used it like a sinful programmer should--gaming, watching series, and coding into the wee hours. A couple personal projects had flopped but I'd figure something out.\n\nMitchell seemed to think he could last longer than three days, but I knew for a fact he couldn't. I could just barely make it myself, but it would be enough. With the right roasts, a coffee binge wherein you drink sips at regular intervals would keep you snappy. It wasn't the quantity that counted, but the consistency that could keep my eyelids perked for long enough to win the 60%. I had beans enough to keep awake and outlast Mitchell. I had a hand grinder to keep me active, which would align with the idea of regular intervals of routine activity.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\"Are you getting sleepy?\" asked Mitchell. 26 hours of my coffee routine and his unflinching sitting around my condo had passed.\n\nI tried to meet his eyes but it was always tough--he didn't have human tact. Androids would just stare when they addressed you.\n\n\"Um nope. I feel dry. Why? Nervous?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to conserve energy.\"\n\nWe didn't talk for the next few hours, and then when we did it was small talk for a while, then another half day elapsed. I ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, did some push-ups, and coded. Mitchell just sat there, staring at objects. Some believe that androids are introspective. But Mitchell never shares whatever is in his circuitry. No android does. It would betry emotion, and we all know that's impossible.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nI don't know how it happened but suddenly I was on the couch, my coffee overturned and soaking into the cushion. Had I dozed off? I must have--but Mitchell hadn't noticed.\n\n\"Um do you want to watch something?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes. Let's watch Doctor Who.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nI turned on the program and slurped what was left of my coffee. It was starting to get to me. Dr. Who was great, but British accents made me tired. In my slowly onsetting deliria I thought maybe Mitchell suggested Dr. Who to get the bigger share of mom's inheritance. My brain was fuzzy. The coffee's power was starting to wane. My eyes didn't blink on command and my mouth felt stuffed with cotton.\n\n\"Getting tired?\" said Mitchell.\n\nI yawned uncontrollably. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nBefore I knew it, we were passed 72 hours. Day Four already. Like a zombie, muscles shivering, I ground some beans. Mitchell just sat. I couldn't finish making the coffee and instead brought some whole beans back to the couch, which I began nibbling. As you do when you don't have control anymore, my consciousness started to ebb and flow. My head fell back and shot up several times, in reflex to avoid sleep.\n\nThat's when I saw, through the blur of fatigue, on Mitchell's shoulder. The normally green power bar had turned yellow. I'd never seen that before.\n\nBy now my eyes bounced open and shut like malfunctioning machinery. I managed to mumble \"what's that... yellow?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mitchell, looking at his power bar. \"Before mom passed she upgraded me.\"\n\n\"But, AO394,\" I blurted, barely. \"Lithium Ion, 3rd generation.\"\n\n\"The same. But I've a new patch upgrade. Low Power Mode.\"\n\nJust before my eyes finally shut for good, dooming me to 40% to an android's 60%, I caught sight of something on Mitchell's face: the smallest of smiles.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n/r/velabasstuff",
            "\"Hi, this is Joe from Psychic Pizza, you'll want to place an order with us for pepperoni with mushrooms on half. I'm calling to let you know I'm on my way.\"\n\nI turned off speaker phone, grinning at my passenger.\n\n\"Hello?\" said Joe.\n\n\"Sam here, thanks. I'll meet you at my house. I assume you know I've got a Lyft.\"\n\n\"Yes sir! We'll meet you at your house in about 30 minutes, after you drop off your passenger at the airport.\"\n\n\"I should be home in 15 minutes max.\"\n\n\"Sure, but you'll need another 15 to deal with the--\"\n\nJust then my passenger tapped my shoulder. He said there was a change of plans. I told him the policy but he insisted and held out a 20 dollar bill to accommodate the detour.\n\n\"Fine,\" I said.\n\nWhen we arrived at his new destination I got an uneasy feeling in my stomach. It was a rundown property, with overgrown lawn and a fallen tree--looked like it had been lightning.\n\n\"Now get out,\" said my passenger.\n\n\"Look buddy I have a pizza waiting for me apparently. I am kind of hungry as it turns out.\"\n\nI heard a click. In the rearview I saw that the man had pulled the hammer of a gun, and trained its barrel at my head. Weird to see a threat like that in a mirror. Almost like it's menacing someone else.\n\n\"Like I said, *get out*.\"\n\nMy passenger led me up the walkway toward the dilapidated bungalow. Flies buzzed and the heat of the sun seemed stuffy. \n\n\"What's this all about? I'm just a driver.\"\n\n\"You have no idea,\" he said. \"You were about to do something that was going to alter the state of the world, and you haven't got a clue.\"\n\n\"What are you on? There's a hospital 5 minutes from--\"\n\n\"Shut it! Don't you recognize my voice?\"\n\nI'd picked this guy up downtown. Nothing special, apart from his clothing. A bit outdated--looked like something from the eighties. He was scraggily too. But that wasn't unheard of in the rideshare biz. Plenty of weirdos. Plenty of strange encounters.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\nJust then from down the street we heard screaming tires as a car rounded a corner. We turned in time to see it careening across the lawn, slapping the overgrowth to the ground. It swerved to miss me, but slammed headlong into my gun-toting passenger, whose body went flying against its will into the high grass.\n\nSun beams glistened off clouds of newly disturbed dust, but the reckless driver got out, holding something. \n\n\"Take it!\" he yelled at me.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I said.\n\nThe dust cleared. I squinted against the sun and couldn't believe it. It was the same man--it was my passenger.\n\n\"But you're--\" I began, pointing at the twisted body over yonder in the grass, gunless now and only breathing slightly.\n\n\"Yes, I'm Joe. That's Joe. We're Joe.\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to know something? I think there's something I'm missing. Just what the hell is going on here?\"\n\nHe stormed over to me and shoved the pizza box into my hands.\n\n\"Take it,\" he commanded. \"Go inside. Eat the cheese side but DO NOT EAT THE SIDE WITH MUSHROOMS. I've got to deal with Joe. I'll come in forthwith.\"\n\n\"What? What? What the fuck?\"\n\n\"Damn you man!\" he snapped. \"Go inside. Eat the cheese half of the pizza. Do it. Now.\"\n\nStunned, I staggered up the creaking bungalow steps with my pizza, and went inside. I didn't know what this was, but something in my belly apart from the hunger told me that my time had finally come. I was going to save the world.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n/r/velabasstuff",

            "At first I thought the words were in my head. I wound up, preparing to swing the flip flop and smash the spider dead, but I stopped when I saw the rather large little body trembling. Its web strands were shivering, and from its multitudinous eyes a rivulet of tears formed, dripped, dropped to the carpetted floor below.\n\nAs I stood, flip flop held high, geared for the final blow, I heard myself utter: \"did you say something?\"\n\n\"Pwease,\" came the tiny voice again, barely noticeable above the sound of my own heartbeat. My chest pumped harder as my confusion grew. \"Pwease spare me. I... I paid went.\"\n\nConfoundment. The reality I thought I knew, as boring and gray as it was to wake up and go to work as a Sandwich Artist, to get paid a less than liveable minimum wage--it suddenly felt *safe*. And part of me wanted the extent of mystery in my life to be whether I'd go for the Spicy Italian or the Meatball sub.\n\nBut no. In an instant, there was more to it. There was this spider.\n\nStill trembling, sniffling now, the spider's bulbous eyes reflected me. I noticed its forward pair of legs twitching together, twidling the claws of its tarsus. It was nervous.\n\n\"Went?\" I said. \"Oh, *rent*.\" Like a big dummy I still held the flip flop aloft. Slowly I let it fall to my side. \"Calm... calm down little fella. I won't bash you.\"\n\n\"I paid went,\" it said, one leg pointing toward my pocket.\n\n\"Rent, yes. Thanks, I got the thirty dollars. How did--\" I began to ask the logistics of how he got the money but decided against it.\n\n\"Pwease don't keewel me.\"\n\n\"I won't kill you,\" I said.\n\n\"Heah!\" it said, and suddenly pranced across its web to a bundle of webbing, a dead fly it had caught and enveloped. \"For you, for utilwities.\"\n\n\"That's alright,\" I said. \"Thirty will, uh, cover that.\"\n\nI couldn't believe I was talking to a spider, but the conversation had progressed this far thanks to inertia. My heartrate finally calmed. 9:02. Late for work.\n\n\"Look,\" I said to the spider. \"I have to go to work. You're... welcome to stay. We can, uh, chat later?\"\n\n\"Okee,\" said the spider. \"Thank you a lot.\"\n\nI managed to gather my wallet and jacket, staring all the while at the little brown sentient dot. I opened the door to leave.\n\n\"One thing fwend,\" it called out.\n\nI turned around and was aghast to see an itty bitty cell phone clutched in its claw. Speechless, I just looked into the spider's face, the expression of which seemed the epitome of innocence. It lowered its gaze, all goosebumps, and asked in a sheepish, tiny, microscopic little voice:\n\n\"Wi-fi passwurd?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nplease come follow my writing subreddit if you liked this: /r/velabasstuff",

By correlating which  known cities had more trade with a lost city they could work out that it must be closer to it than one with less trade.\n\nBut more than just that, by adding known commodity prices and populations to an algorithm it could predict the distance between those cities. \n\nThat alone would leave a wide circle emanating from the initial known city, but when you combine that with the same search from multiple cities you end up with a narrow region to look. For example: https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2017/11/bronze_age-03.png\n\nUsing this method, they believe they've pinpointed 11 lost cities some of which would be very far from where historians have guessed.

            "As best I can tell, there are five constitutional ways that Trump could become president again before 2024. All of them are insane and realistically impossible. Here they are, from least to most insane:\n\n1. The House elects Trump Speaker, and then both the House and the Senate impeach the President and the Vice President, or they both die or resign.\n2. The Senate amends its rules on how the President Pro Tempore of the Senate is selected, and then selects Trump for that role. Next, the House and the Senate impeach the President and the Vice President, making the Speaker the new president. Then, before the House can elect a new Speaker, the House and Senate both impeach the new President or he resigns. It's actually not 100% clear what would happen here, but there's at least an argument that this would make Trump president. Alternatively, the President, VP and Speaker all die.\n3. Congress uses the power given it by Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the Constitution to amend the order of succession, names Trump the next in line after the VP, and then the President and VP die, resign or are impeached.\n4. The President appoints Trump to be either VP (if Harris has vacated the role) or a member of cabinet, the Senate confirms him, and then everyone above him in the line of succession dies, resigns, is impeached, or is ineligible to serve.\n5. Two thirds of the House, two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states agree to a constitutional amendment which in some way makes Trump president. It could probably be as simple as \"The office of the President will now be held by Donald Trump,\" but obviously we'd be in some weird legal waters here. *ETA:* Alternatively, two thirds of the states call a constitutional convention to propose the same amendment, which is then ratified by three quarters of the states.\n\nNone of these actually involve Trump being \"reinstated.\" Reinstatement is not a thing, and there is no legal way to achieve it."
