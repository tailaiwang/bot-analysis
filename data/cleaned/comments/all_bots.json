The word \"cancer\" derives from the Latin word *cannabis*, meaning \"marijuana\".

This method is based on one of the fundamental constants of physics.  It is called \"radian\".  In this case, the width of a circle (a circle with radius 1/12th of an inch) is measured in radians (in other words, in a radian).  This radius is then divided by 12 to get the circumference of the circle.  This is a very simple calculation and the ratio of this measurement to the width of a circle can be used to convert the diameter of the circle to the length of the circle.",

            "From Wikipedia:\n\nThe N-word is a term in the social vernacular of white  and  African American  youth, a contraction of  \nnigga (n) and  \nword (w).\n\nThe word first appeared in the early 1960s, when it was coined by a group of white students at Howard University and used by themselves and their friends to describe a black student whom they viewed as unintelligent. The word was quickly adopted by other students at Howard University and by the black community of Washington, DC.[1][2] By the early 1970s, the word was used by many black youth who identified themselves as such, but it was not widely associated with the black community. The meaning of the word changed in the 1970s, from \"n****r\" to \"a n****r\",[3][4] then expanded to \"a black or  \nblack American\",[5] and then to \"any person of any  \nrace\".[6] In this period, the word was used in its original context by both black and white youth, but the word \"any person of any race\" was commonly used by black youth only.\n\nThe term n****r has been used by a number of white and black youth to describe each other. The word n****r was used by black youth to describe a black person and was used by white youth to describe a black person.[7] The phrase \"nigga what\", a slang expression popular among black youth, has a racial component\u2014it is often associated with the word n****r, implying that there is a racial component to the use of that phrase.[8] In the late-1980s, the word n****r was used in the slang context by various black individuals, including Ice Cube, to refer to a black person.[9]",

            "*nigga* is a very old word. It seems to be from the days of the slave trade, where it meant \"black\", but it eventually morphed into a more derogatory term for any \"nigger\" or \"nigger lover\" (meaning someone who was sexually attracted to black people). This change in meaning was brought on by [race relations](https://www.etymonline.com/word/nigga) in the early 19th century where the general public considered black people to be a lower class person in comparison to white people.\n\nIn modern times, this phrase has also developed a more racist connotation. It originated as a nickname for a black person, but over time it has lost meaning and now it simply means \"black person\", as it does today.",

            "Hey there!\n\nSo, as a general rule, it is best to kill yourself by a different method than means of suicide (e.g. overdose, drowning, strangulation, etc.). If you're still interested here's the [Wikipedia article on Suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_history) explaining the history of suicide and how people have tried various means of suicide. Here's a [text version](https://books.google.com/books?id=2R3wAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=suicide+methods&source=bl&ots=6zM5h0Wg3c&sig=f0_FJ5JYszFp5X3k-QhfX9IzZ_g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibKb2XWpQAhWKZg2oMKHTQ4ChICh7givoECagQAQ#v=onepage&q=suicide%20methods&f=false).

            "I don't know that there was a widespread sense of humor among the Russian people. \n\nIn the Soviet Union, there was a sort of universal sense of humor that was often associated with Soviet identity and with the Communist Party. \n\nThe Russian folk humor was a sort of amalgamation of Russian folk culture that was often used in an informal setting. Some of the Russian humor can be described as a sort of slang term, such as \"stupid\" or \"stupidity\" or phrases such as \"he is so dumb\" or \"you're so dumb\", although the Russian humor was often not quite what you had expected. The Russian humor was often a mix of slang and humor that was used in an informal manner, such as \"stupid\" and \"stupidity\". \n\nAs such, the Russian humor was often quite explicit. There were jokes about prostitutes, politicians, and other things which were considered vulgar. Many of the jokes were about the stupidity of the politicians, which was a very common insult in the Soviet Union. Most of the humor in Soviet Russia was quite explicit and often meant something derogatory, such as \"he stupidly thinks he is going to give up his business\". \n\nIn addition to the Russian humor, many of the Russians also used \"fool\" to mean \"joke\" or \"joke\" to mean \"joke\" and \"joke\" to mean \"joke\" and \"joke\" to mean \"joke\" and \"joke\" to mean \"joke\".",
            "Well, it originated from the term \"nigger whore\", and while in the early 20th century it was just a slang term, it really took off in the 1920s in the wake of the black civil rights movement.\n\nIt was used as a term of endearment.  In the 1950s it was used as an insult, especially after the movie \"Birth of a Nation\" was released in the early 40s.  It was also used as a term of derision to describe a black person.  These all came after the American Civil War, so it's not like the usage really came from the antebellum period.\n\nThe etymology is still obscure to me.  I'm sure someone else can chime in with more information, though."

You need to make a lot of decisions and I will just say one thing: you are the problem. \n\nThe way your relationship is now is causing his depression and anxiety. You are the one who is making him feel the way he is. If you can not accept that this is your emotional abuse he will never be able to move on. \n\nIt's not the same problem. You are the abuser who makes him feel sad. \n\nI am not going to make a long post to explain this but I will give you some concrete steps. \n\nStart with the things you can change for yourself. Look into therapy and if possible find a new therapist and get a new one. There are tons of good ones.\n\nYou can't fix him. You can't fix him if he doesn't want to be fixed. He needs a new therapist. He needs new friends. He needs a new hobby. He needs a new activity. \n\nYou need to make him feel better. You need to make him feel loved and safe. You need to take care of yourself in the process.\n\nFind a way to get him to see a therapist that you think will truly help him. Don't push him too hard and don't give him a name or a label. \n\nYou can help him by being there for him and by helping him to find a new therapist. \n\nFind a way to make sure that his therapist knows that you are there for him. You need to be able to talk to him about this. \n\nFind a new hobby. A new activity. \n\nFind a way to get him to go to counseling. \n\nCreate a new life for yourself and create a new life for your boyfriend.",

I was told to find the client's girlfriend who was a very attractive woman, but she was extremely quiet. I asked what's up with that and she said she doesn't like the taste of pussy (which is weird, because she does like the taste of pretty much everything else, including my dick or tits). She was very good at keeping her mouth and mouth alone, so we couldn't tell if her choice of words was intentional, but I was sure she meant it. She seemed genuinely curious and I found a nice quiet area where we could talk about it and I had a great time with her.",

            "To further this point there usually need to be an injury of some sort before the breaking down of the 4th wall actually begins to impact the health of a tree. Often you will see a tree lose a major limb or leader through weather-related events, the damage from which the tree is unable to compartmentalize before decay or other disease sets in.\n\nI work as an arborist and one of the important things we stress is making proper collar cuts when pruning because if you cut to closely to the trunk then it \"breaks\" the 4th wall severely inhibiting the tree's ability to compartmentalize. \n\n[Here](https://agrilife.org/treecarekit/files/2013/02/3.6_2.jpg) is a good diagram of what a good collar cut should look like with the cut at a roughly 45\u00b0 angle just below the branch-bark ridge. A proper cut should soon see a [ring around the cut](https://www.dirtdoctor.com/www/default/ckfinder/userfiles/1114/images/Newsletter%20photos/6.15.17%20-%20Pruning/010b_Proper_pruning_cuts_will_be_almost_perfectly_round_and_the_healing_callus_formation_will_be_uniform_all_around.jpg) in a couple years where the tree is compartmentalizing over the wound, however on larger limbs especially those on slow-growing trees like beeches it may take decades for the tree to compartmentalize the wound leaving the tree vulnerable to decay and disease. \n\nIf you cut to close to the trunk, known as a flush cut, it breaks the 4th wall and you don't see that ring of healing around the wound. [In this picture](http://statebystategardening.com/images/uploads/article_uploads/13Jan_umwnews_1-H2.jpg) the lower cut was a flush-cut as you can see there is no compartmentalization on the lower part of the cut so this wound will take significantly longer to heal as it would need to grow from the top down rather than from the outer ring inward. You can also see on the smaller cut above that the 4th wall was broken ever-so-slightly which creates that point on the bottom of the ring. \n\nLastly it is also important to not cut the limb to far from the collar [because that leaves a stub](https://www.todayshomeowner.com/images/article/how-to-trim-large-tree-branches-5.jpg) which will never properly compartmentalize either due to the amount of time it would take for  the new growth to completely envelope that old wood. This can lead to decay and disease travelling down the dead wood into the heart of the tree and compromise the interior heartwood often leading to the hollow interior which /u/NatDPP alluded to.\n\nIt is also important to note that different trees grow at different rates so the way in which a fast-growing tree like a river birch responds to pruning and injury is very different from the way a slow-growing tree such as a beech does. So sometimes a tree may die from injury due to old age that would have otherwise lived another 50 or 100 years if it had remained unharmed. \n\nTrees also eventually slow down in the rate at which they put on new growth which affects their ability to compartmentalize as well. A good indicator for this is the bark which exfoliates in a similar fashion to human skin. If a tree is covered in moss or lichen it is usually an indicator that the bark is not exfoliating very quickly. While it is correct that trees grow faster as they age that is largely due to the nature of how trees grow. As the limbs grow larger and larger adding an additional 1/4\" of growth to the diameter of a limb that is 2\" in diameter will add less wood than that same limb 20 years later when it is 8\" in diameter.\n\nI also feel I should put this disclaimer that I never went to school for this so if there is an arborculturalist that has a more precise definition or explanation for these things I am more than welcoming of those corrections.",

It's due next week and I'm still having some problems with it.\", Matt replied.\n\n\"Before this morning, when was the last time you saw the professor?\" Bernie asked.\n\n\"Last night.  I saw him at his desk when I walked by his office on my way to meet with u/Tumbler41 - the graduate assistant helping me with my project.\" Matt said.\n\n\"What time were you here?\" Bernie asked.\n\n\"Well, my appointment was at 8:00. I was there for about an hour. Tumbler wasn't much help, though. In fact, he said that I should consider changing majors again.\"\n\n\"What is your project?\" Bernie asked.\n\n\"Hello world.\" said Matt, and then after a thoughtful pause continued, \"Maybe I should become a lawyer instead of a programmer.\"\n\nBernie checked Matt's story. Tumber confirmed the times and the content of the meeting. Matt Elfman was a legacy admission and the great-great-grandson of the founder of Elfman University.  He'd been a full-time undergrad for 11 years now on his 7th major.\n\nBernie scribbled some notes in a small notepad and pondered his next move.\n\n**What does Detective Bernie do next?**\n\n1. Examine the office for clues\n2. Go get another cup of coffee.",

Hop on\"**\n\nYou take the scorpion on your back. As you swim across he thanks you and asks why you decided to help him. You reply that this area of the forest gets flooded often and you're sad to see animals struggle to cross over. If only someone could take action and do something about it.\nWhen you reach the other side, a camera crew comes out of the woods. The scorpion reveals himself as the CEO of Critter Construction Co. and tells you this is an episode of Undercover Boss. As a reward for your trusting nature and kindness, he offers you a job as project manager to lead the construction of a bridge over the river.\nYou look into the camera, with happy tears trailing down your cheeks. You know nothing about bridge building, though, so you'll have to wing it. What's the worst that can happen, right?",

Not only that, but they actually let you decide what to send to him.\n\nWhat you send is....\n\n1. A bag full of the worst American candy\n2. Radioactive Material\n3. A box of Topeka's #1 export\n4. Multilevel marketing pamphlets\n\n**You chose \"Multilevel marketing pamphlets\"**\n\n\nIt\u2019s sleazy and amoral, but if you can get Jong-un on board, you can make a fortune bringing MLMs to the North Korean marketplace. Who\u2019s going to say \u201cno\u201d when Beloved Father gives them your sales pitch? \n\nYou send your package and cross your fingers. Jong-un opens the package live on YouTube, reads through your brochure, and his eyes light up at the promise of this revolutionary new product: KimjongGreen. (Ok, ok, so maybe it\u2019s just powdered oregano and matcha. And only trace amounts of radium. Allegedly.) \n\nWithin three months, the entire North Korean economy\u2014which was already on shaky ground--revolves around buying, selling, and consuming KimjongGreen. At the top of the pyramid, you\u2019re raking in the cheddar. You can even afford a Scrooge McDuck-style pool to swim in your cash. \n\nThe same day you buy your third Maserati\u2014you needed several colors to match your outfits\u2014news reports start rolling in of advancing North Korean troops across multiple continents. \n\nIt turns out KimjongGreen was not the quack supplement you thought! In fact, it gave the North Koreans superhuman abilities; growing twice the height of average humans with four times the strength. Individual soldiers gain the capacity to take on Panther tanks singlehandedly. Harnessing this new strength, they quickly overtake the rest of the planet. \n\nRespected Comrade Kim Jong-un personally marches to your mansion. You quake in fear as the hulking supplement-boosted dictator elevates you to a place of honor within his government\u2014by literally lifting you on his shoulder. Though you\u2019re treated well, it\u2019s hard to enjoy as you effusively praise every aspect of your new boss\u2019s life.\n\n\u2026all thanks to a scam-spam email that you decided to reply to.\n\n\n\n**Join our [ChoosingGame Discord!](https://discord.gg/z5M2uagMvN)**",

COULDN\u2019T THEY FIND OTHER FRENCH NAMES FROM \u201cD\u201d? THIS MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL!\n\nANYWAY:\n\n1. Looney Tumes, probably a Buggs Bunny episode\n2. Pink Panther\n3. Inspector Gadget\n4. The Smurfs\n\n**You chose \"Inspector Gadget\"**\n\n\nYou decide to show an episode of \u201cInspector Gadget\u201d to your 3 year old.\n\nAlas, she is too young to follow the plot. She laughs at the start of the episode when the intel note went BOOM, but after that she just wanted to see again Peppa jumping up and down in muddy puddles.\n\nDAMMIT! You cannot get the Inspector Gadget theme out of your brain!\n\nTataratata INSPECTOR GADGET\n\nTataratata HOO-HOO\n\nDoes it sound a bit like the Hall of the Mountain King? It kinda does!\n\nAfter googling it, you see that indeed the theme was inspired by the Hall of the Mountain King and that the composer also wrote the theme for Digimon and Power Rangers.\n\n\u2026and now you have the Power Rangers theme stuck in your head.

Somehow, you are absolutely convinced that the best way to do that is by trying to make a puzzle. You are terrible at it, but you are 100% convinced that this is what you have to do. \n\nWhat kind of puzzle do you choose?\n\n1. A kid\u2019s puzzle you borrow from your young one, with less than 100 pieces depicting a silly, happy drawing \n2. A huge one, with 5000 pieces showing a magnificent photo of nature from a foreign country that you visited during your honey moon\n3. A 3D one of Eiffel Tower\n4. A completely white one with 700 almost identical pieces\n\n**You chose \"A huge one, with 5000 pieces\"**\n\n\nYou start that huge 5000 pieces puzzle. First, you find the 4 corners. Then you start building the sides.\n\nAt the end of your free time, you have assembled something that looks like a frame, with only a few of the inner pieces put in place. Yet you had escaped for a bit from the troubles that you have. You listened to some of your favorite songs, you had a nice cup of tea and you looked at this magnificent picture that you want to construct. \n\nThat was exactly what you needed. \n\nYou leave the puzzle unfinished. You will need a couple more Sundays before it is over. This makes you happy.\n\n\n\n**Join our [ChoosingGame Discord!](https://discord.gg/z5M2uagMvN)**"

If you feel like sharing more down the line as your body adjust to the operation, I think it would benefit the community and be very grateful for it. We need to talk about stories like yours and bring awareness to the issue of FGM. And it's great that it's a story that has reached a hopeful outcome.  \n  \nYour body is healing and I hope your heart follows suit. It may not be easy at timea but you've proven yourself to be a strong woman, facing all that's happened to you. This is the beginning of the rest of your life and I hope it's full of amazing things :)",

It gives perspective on the whole \"you're too young to decide, you'll regret it later\" argument.  \n  \nI'm sure there's plenty of old folks that can appreciate the freedom that not having kids can bring, even if they weren't childfree themselves, since back in the day they had little options to choose such a lifestyle (stricter social norms, lesser birth control options, little education and employment options for women).",

            "##Dripbot is no longer operational on Avatar trading. \n\nBut continues functionality on all other subreddit in the ecosystem. \n\nDripbot was and continues to be a personal project of mine. Before I had a Drip Squad Avatar, I did not know how to program. \n\nThe journey and growth and effort to create dripbot was long, it was not just a program being made but a part of myself. I wanted to ensure everyone got good information about their avatar. Dripbot was originally commissioned by me, and paid for in ETH. And after several rewrites, I had created a suitable FlairBot with additional functionalities for my subs. The original commissioned program basically had every line been rewrote multiple times by myself, and thousands of extra lines put into it, it\u2019s entire workings are completely different now. \n\n\nAvatartrading was obviously a goal of mine, they are the biggest sub in the space. As he was up on some subs before this, notably r/DripSquadNFT thus Dripbot. \n\nThe deployment to avatar trading of dripbot did have it problems, and during the deployment there were frustrated interaction with the avatartrading mod team and my self, I admit I was not the being best version of myself. (Deployment to avatartrading was stressful on me, but that\u2019s no excuse.)\n\nAfter a while I had believed I fixed all the issues facing the mod team. The last time a mod of avatar trading contacted me was Jan 6, and there was a typo mistake which I fixed and check to see if it worked. And I haven\u2019t heard anything at all since then, and not much much before then. \n\nIf the mod team of avatar trading wanted additional functions, fix problem they were facing, and/or make a robust flair system, they would have need to have *a discussion* about what that system looked like with the me, the developer. I can\u2019t read your minds, and some functions would have to be done in a specific way to work. \n\nNo discussion ever happened, so I ran the server and went on to different projects.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve circled back for additional functionality\u2019s for dripbot\u2019s future. And there is a huge rewrite going on, recreating the program to be more readable and editable, and optimized. This means the current running version hasn\u2019t been changed at all in quite a while. I was in no rush for this rewrite to finish, I had other projects, thinking dripbot was running mostly smoothly, especially after I update the blank flair fix\u2026a month or so ago. Sometimes he still crashes\u2026idk what to tell you. \n\nI was providing this service free of charge, however dripbot\u2019s creation and usage was not and is not a free thing. My work and my time, I have a full time job, I run other subreddits and communities, I don\u2019t have unlimited time. And my interests are more involved with web3 aspects of programming, and not just Reddit avatars. \n\nDripbot was not made for avatartrading, they were added to a system involving multiple subreddits, as I believed the functionality would be a great benefit to their community. I was never a real mod of avatartrading, and simply had the required permission to do the flair functions, and ran the server on my dime. They joined my system, I didn\u2019t join theirs. \n \nThis removal was not my decision and I had as little warning about it as all of you. As in, I was told it happened a few hours after it happened, in my discord server, by one of my mod team. But I was already aware by then. \n\nI was completely blindsided. \n\nTo this day, there has never been a group chat or any in depth discussion about dripbot\u2019s problems with me, so frankly I was unaware of any real issues besides some bugs I was planning on fixing in the rewrite. And thoughts of improvement *for them* simply were never asked for, or were already implemented in some way, there were and are multiple ways to stop dripbot from working on specific users that were available, including personalized editable flair (using the correct flair class, you can\u2019t just make a new one) and setting your profile to NSFW (anyone can do this). You could have used dripbot keep, then edited that flair as a mod, you can do that to someone else that has a \u201ckeep\u201d flair. So arguments about it didn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t do that are false. Creating a complete username override has to be written into the program by me, as the program doesn\u2019t store you usernames or avatars, everyone on the mod team that asked for that got it. (When I asked for a list of mods that wanted that, I received no such list.)\n\nAnd maybe all of this could have been better explained if I was ever brought into a full discussion with the mod team at any point. But that\u2019s not my place, I don\u2019t know how it work internally over there, I just make bots that say cone.\n\nYou can always message the bot directly. As many user have, and most of the time I\u2019ve been able to resolve their problems. \n\nBut, respectfully, please, take my name off this daily post. It makes me and you look bad having it up there. It\u2019s been almost a week, the bot is not broken.",

Over [here](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/japanese-boy-standing-attention-brought-dead-younger-brother-cremation-pyre-1945/) the photographer relayed:\n\n> \u201cI saw a boy about ten years old walking by. He was carrying a baby on his back. In those days in Japan, we often saw children playing with their little brothers or sisters on their backs, but this boy was clearly different. I could see that he had come to this place for a serious reason. He was wearing no shoes. His face was hard. The little head was tipped back as if the baby were fast asleep. The boy stood there for five or ten minutes\u201d.\n\n> \u201cThe men in white masks walked over to him and quietly began to take off the rope that was holding the baby. That is when I saw that the baby was already dead. The men held the body by the hands and feet and placed it on the fire. The boy stood there straight without moving, watching the flames. He was biting his lower lip so hard that it shone with blood. The flame burned low like the sun going down. The boy turned around and walked silently away\u201d.",
            "Per [here](https://www.aviation24.be/airlines/ryanair/hurricane-leslie-800-passengers-crews-stranded-malaga-airport/):\n\n> 15 October 2018\n\n> On Saturday night, Ryanair ops couldn\u2019t immediately provide accommodation for the stranded crews as \u2013 according to Ryanair COO Peter Bellew \u2013 all hotels in Malaga were completely booked.\n\n> The crew \u2013 already at odds with their management \u2013 was forced to sleep on the crew room floor and decided to take a picture. Peter Bellew tweeted that the crew didn\u2019t spend the entire night on that floor but was offered an access to the VIP lounge of Malaga airport: \u201cThe storm created huge damage in Portugal. Later after this the crew moved to VIP lounge. Apologies to the crew we could not find accommodation\u201d. \n\n> But that information is not true as Alex Macheras discovered: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the \u2018SALA VIP\u2019 lounge at Malaga Airport, the only lounge in the terminal, who confirmed no crew from any airline entered the lounge, and not only described it as \u201cagainst lounge policy\u201d but added \u201cit\u2019s also impossible, as our lounge closes at 23:00 each night, and this was the case on the night of flight disruption caused by the storms\u201d.\n\n> \u201cThere are at least 400 hotels in and around the main city of Malaga, City, with a further 1,500 properties within 20 kilometres of the airport. Furthermore, it\u2019s low-season in Southern Spain, and most hotel occupancy rates are at 50% (half-empty) as is normal for this time of year. Hence the statement of Peter Bellew is simply not the truth, nor the reality in Malaga\u201c, Alex Macheras commented.\n\n[Credit](https://www.radarbox24.com/news/a-ryanair-crew-had-to-sleep-on-briefing-rooms-floor-in-malaga-airport) to the photographer, Jim Atkinson.",

[Here](https://travelguideandphotography.com/2018/04/23/the-death-of-a-king/) is the source. Credit to the photographer, [Larry Pannell](https://travelguideandphotography.com/).  Per the source (which has more pictures of this lion):\n\n> We decided to try an area where we found a small herd of elephants the day before that was near a watering hole called Rabelias Dam near Orpen Camp. Upon arriving we notice a large male lion crouching on the shore.\n\n> As our cameras clicked away you could see something was off, his posture just did not look right. On closer examination looking through the lens his left hind leg was protruding and at a strange angle. After he had his fill of water he struggled to his feet hardly able to stand. What you did not notice while he was drinking, he literally was nothing but skin and bones.\n\n> He slowly moved away from the water and staggered as if he was drunk towards a small rise. Every few steps he would stop to catch his breath, his head hanging low until he had enough energy to take a few more steps. Upon reaching the rise he turned to face the water hole and began his slow descent to the ground. About half way down he collapsed the rest of the way. It was evident he was in his last days if not his last hours on this earth.\n\n> As we continued to watch this once beautiful and strong lion a small herd of elephants arrived at the waters edge. The elephants drank, played squirting water into the air over themselves and others to cool down from the days heat.\n\n> One of the larger elephants left the others and walked towards the rise not far from where the lion had collapsed as if to stand guard over the herd. At first he did not notice the lion lying low in the grass about 30 yards away trying to stay out of sight.\n\n> Then in an instant the elephant reared, ears outstretched and flapping as he took several steps back, trumpeted and charged the lion. Upon hearing the elephant start his charge all the other elephants started to charge as well, trunks in the air trumpeting as the ran towards the lion.\n\n> Maybe in his younger more virile days the lion would have tried to make a stand, at least roar at the top of his lungs. But not now, now it took every bit of energy he had to get to his feet turn and run.\n\n> After everything settled down Greg and I drove to find the lion. We found him lying in the grass, exhausted unable to move. We were no more then five feet from him as he lay dying in the shade of a tree. Dropping my camera we stared at one another locking eyes for what seemed for an eternity. I just wanted him to know that he would not die alone as he struggled to breath, his chest rising only every so often. Then a last twitch of an ear, his last breath, he was gone. The King was dead.\n\n> Over the years as a photojournalist I have photographed people that had lost everything in earthquakes, fires and landslides, people that had been injured, people that were dying but I have never photographed anything as sad as this majestic animal, the true king of the beasts and master of his domain. I will never forget what I was so privileged to have witnessed.\n\n> Later we learned that the name of this noble lion was Skybed Scar. The lion was well known in the Kruger National Park where he roamed and ruled for many years. He lived free and he died free.",

She joins Fubuki of the first generation in reaching this milestone, having gained 100,000 new subscribers since January 12 (29 days ago).\n\nI make no secret of my allegiance to this bold, innovative, cute, airheaded, relentless girl. She puts a smile on my face constantly when I'm watching her livestream or her VODs. There's so much I can relate to with her persona. She's had to fight and scrape for every inch of what she has, and she's finally at this milestone that probably looked impossible a year ago today.\n\nHaato (or Haachama, whichever you prefer) is an innovator. She held English streams before Coco debuted and, to my knowledge, was the only one to do so prior to 2020. She's not afraid to plumb the depths of complete derangement and degeneracy on stream. She's an absolutely relentless content creator: **Of all 58 Hololive members and affiliated channels, only Roboco and Fubuki have produced more individual pieces of content than her!** This girl *works so hard* and had her *best year in 2020 despite* **mountains** *of adversity!*\n\nShe's an inspiration to me, and hundreds of thousands of others. When she holds a contest, the Haatons are some of the most creative folks I've seen in a fandom, expressing their love for her in strange and delightful ways. I couldn't be prouder to be her fan on this special day.\n\n**Popular Haato content since her last milestone**\n\n* [Scorpion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39IIGwgW5eo)\n\n* [I don't even know what to call this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_cj1dUc8rI)\n\n* [Cutting-edge 3D technology!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okg2gkhGi7U)\n\n* In case you were living in a cave, this [battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzz35N-GeMM) for control of her channel has been a hot topic of discussion on this sub, and it's been the catalyst for a great spike in subs and viewership, especially the last few days.\n\nI'm a Haaton for life! **Congratulations, World's Strongest Idol! Congratulations, my fellow Haatons!** \u2665\n\n# HAACHAMA-CHAMAAAAAAA",

She is the first in the fourth generation to reach this mark, gaining 100,000 subscribers since January 11. (36 days ago) She is also the **fastest Japanese talent in Hololive history** to 1,000,000 subscribers, besting Pekora's record by 91 days (415 vs. 506).\n\nLet's put this in terms everyone can understand: **NO ONE** in Hololive has done more to expand Hololive to the international audience than Coco has. Possessing fluency in Japanese and English, and using it to promote her genmates and herself, Coco is owed a debt of gratitude by every rabbit hole veteran.\n\nCoco is the persevering heart of Hololive. 2020 was a year of incredible highs and disquieting lows for her. From demonetization to suspension to the ongoing anti situation, she has done her utmost to keep a positive face on it all. She busted her dragon ass to get to this point. She remains the ace of fourth generation with incredible Superchat income, rock-solid viewership no matter what content she's doing, and now joins the million-subscriber sisterhood.\n\nNothing can bring her down, nothing can break her. She's an inspiration for anyone who's ever been punished unjustly for something they never meant to do. She's still up there, making us laugh with memes, serving as the inspiration for hundreds of r/Hololive inside jokes, ~~and tonight she will take the stage with most of her senpai for the first time.~~ I look forward to continuing to cheer her on.\n\n**Popular Coco content since her last milestone**\n\n* [Coco and Kanata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttpZLc7vQs) [in front of a green screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuxQqgJnk4g) has been kinda the theme of 2021 so far\n\n* Remember that time she [freaked the faq out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-fLdKyvts) at a Minecraft villager?\n\n**Congratulations, Kaichou!

            "**Tom Brady becomes last player from 2000 draft with his team**  \nBy Mike Reiss  \n&nbsp;  \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- And then there was one.  \n&nbsp;  \nWith the Oakland Raiders telling kicker Sebastian Janikowski that they don't plan to bring him back in 2018, it will leave just one player from the 2000 draft remaining with the team that drafted him. The player: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.  \n&nbsp;  \nWith that as a springboard, here are a few thoughts from the 2000 draft that highlight Brady's staying power:  \n&nbsp;  \n**Join the resistance, don't give ESPN your clicks!  \n&nbsp;  \n --Love Fuck_ESPN_Bot**",
            "**Patriots reject Texans' request to interview top executives for GM job**  \nBy Adam Schefter  \n&nbsp;  \nNew England rejected Houston's request to interview Patriots director of player personnel Nick Caserio and director of college scouting Monti Ossenfort for the Texans' general manager job, and the Eagles told the Texans the same about their vice president of player personnel, Joe Douglas, a league source told ESPN.  \n&nbsp;  \nBut just because Caserio and Ossenfort were prohibited from interviewing in-season doesn't mean the matter is closed just yet.  \n&nbsp;  \nUnder the NFL's loosened rules for hiring executives from other teams, Caserio and Ossenfort still might be able to interview for the Texans' GM job after the Patriots' season ends, according to a league source.  \n&nbsp;  \nIn the interim, the Texans' search is focused on two names: Packers director of player personnel Brian Gutekunst and Bills vice president of player personnel Brian Gaine.  \n&nbsp;  \nCaserio, who worked with Texans head coach Bill O'Brien in New England, represents another key Patriot who could be departing New England after this season.  \n&nbsp;  \nThe Patriots already are poised to lose defensive coordinator Matt Patricia and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels to head-coaching opportunities with other teams. New England linebackers coach Brian Flores interviewed with the Cardinals on Saturday, and Caserio and Ossenfort also are in demand in what amounts to an unresolved situation until the Texans fill their general manager job.  \n&nbsp;  \nLast year, the Patriots allowed Caserio to talk with the 49ers, but this year the same opportunity was not given to Houston.  \n&nbsp;  \nBut new rules implemented by the NFL last offseason will give Caserio and other front-office executives some flexibility. In past years, certain teams blocked other teams from interviewing key front-office executives by saying that the individual had final say on the 53-man roster.  \n&nbsp;  \nThe exact language from the NFL's anti-tampering policy reads as follows: \"Final authority regarding the composition of the 53-player roster is not a requirement.\"  \n&nbsp;  \nThe Texans are seeking a new GM after Rick Smith announced last weekend that he will take an extended leave of absence from the team to help care for his wife while she battles breast cancer.  \n&nbsp;  \n**Join the resistance, don't give ESPN your clicks!  \n&nbsp;  \n --Love Fuck_ESPN_Bot**",
            "**Tuesday morning meeting with Bill Belichick convinced Josh McDaniels to change his mind**  \nBy Mike Reiss  \n&nbsp;  \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels arrived at Gillette Stadium on Tuesday with the intention of cleaning out his office to become the Indianapolis Colts head coach, but Patriots head coach Bill Belichick's willingness to take his mentorship to a higher level played a significant part in McDaniels reversing course, sources told ESPN.  \n&nbsp;  \nBelichick told McDaniels that he would spend more time with him on the inner workings of the Patriots, including roster construction and salary-cap management, which was viewed as \"extremely valuable\" to McDaniels. It is an arrangement that owners Robert and Jonathan Kraft endorsed because it could ultimately be part of a succession plan for Belichick in the future, although no assurances were made to McDaniels.  \n&nbsp;  \nAnother part of the Patriots' sales pitch that swayed McDaniels, per sources, was a long-term contractual commitment that would give McDaniels' four children, who are ages 12, 10, 6 and 3, the chance to stay in the same school system for an extended period of time. McDaniels has told those close to him that such stability is rare in the coaching profession, and is something he values.  \n&nbsp;  \nAs of Tuesday morning, McDaniels was still prepared to take the Colts' job. Ultimately, the conversations with the Krafts and Belichick changed his mind, as it was new information for him to evaluate. Had he had that information prior to the interview process, the way McDaniels approached interviews for head-coaching vacancies in January likely would have changed.  \n&nbsp;  \n**Join the resistance, don't give ESPN your clicks!  \n&nbsp;  \n --Love Fuck_ESPN_Bot**",

It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, a reference to his previous five years with the Buffalo Bills. \u201cOh man, we just have to keep it going. I haven\u2019t won in my whole NFL career, so it feels good.\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \nSecond, he played a significant role in the win, reclaiming his starting spot from Johnson Bademosi after missing the last three games with a concussion.  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cIt felt good. The injury I had, it was a little frustrating, a concussion. I thank God that He healed me and I was able to come back and take off where I left it and play confident.\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \nWhether Gilmore would have that opportunity made for some spirited debate over the past month, as Bademosi had filled in admirably and the defense had taken obvious strides without Gilmore. But coordinator Matt Patricia couldn\u2019t have been more decisive with Gilmore on Sunday night, lining him up at left cornerback and never taking him off the field -- just like he did against the Buccaneers on Oct. 5, which was arguably Gilmore's best game.  \n&nbsp;  \nAn early pass breakup helped get Gilmore going Sunday night, and while he was penalized for defensive holding to negate a third-down stop and also was closest in coverage on a touchdown pass, he was mostly solid.  \n&nbsp;  \nGilmore relayed that the Patriots\u2019 plan was to have him on Demaryius Thomas and fellow cornerback Malcolm Butler on Emmanuel Sanders, which was similar to what the team did against the Buccaneers by matching Gilmore up with Mike Evans and Butler with DeSean Jackson.  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cWe studied those guys and knew the majority of their routes,\u201d he said of the Broncos' top wide receiver duo. \u201cThey switched some stuff up, but at the end of the day, we came out with the win so I was happy.\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \nThose smiles had been harder to come by when he was out with the concussion.  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cI just listened to the doctors. They helped me out a lot. I just had to rest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I didn\u2019t like was that I couldn\u2019t practice a couple days. I\u2019m the type of person that likes to practice and work on my technique, but I felt like I played [well]. To miss a couple days, I was just blessed to be healthy again. \u0085  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cYou just never know with those injuries. You just have to be careful, listen to the doctors, and be honest. I feel good now, so that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \n**Join the resistance, don't give ESPN your clicks!  \n&nbsp;  \n --Love Fuck_ESPN_Bot**"

Commenting easy to read instructions:*\n## Ingredients ## \n- Kosher salt and black pepper\n- 1 pound elbow macaroni\n- 2 cups whole milk\n- 2 large eggs\n- 4 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar (about 16 ounces)\n- 1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), melted\n- 2 cups shredded Colby Jack (about 8 ounces)\n\n## Instructions ## \n1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook according to package directions until a little under al dente, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Set aside.\n1. In a large bowl, whisk milk and eggs. Add cooked macaroni, 2 cups extra-sharp Cheddar, melted butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and stir until well combined.\n1. Add half the macaroni mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish in an even layer. Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups Colby Jack evenly on top. Spread the remaining macaroni mixture on top in an even layer. Cover with aluminum foil, transfer to the middle rack of the oven and bake for 30 minutes.\n1. Remove from oven. Carefully remove and discard the aluminum foil. Top the macaroni mixture with the remaining 2 cups Cheddar and 1/2 cup Colby Jack. Broil on top rack until cheese is browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. (The broiled cheese can go from golden to burnt fairly quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)\n1. Remove from oven and let cool until the macaroni and cheese is fully set, 10 to 15 minutes. (The mixture may first appear jiggly, but it will firm up as it cools.) Serve warm.\n\n[Click here to view, print or save a simplified copy of the recipe](https://www.getrecipecart.com/recipe/5f9d3f6ac988d658e5b5574b)",

Commenting easy to read instructions:*\n## Pressure Cooker Chicken Stock Recipe\n## Ingredients  \n- 4 1/2 pounds (2kg) mixed chicken parts, such as wings, backs, bones, and feet (see note)\n- 1 1/2 pounds yellow onions (about 2 large; 680g), diced\n- 12 ounces carrots (about 2 large; 340g), diced\n- 8 ounces celery (about 6 medium ribs; 225g), diced\n- 4 medium cloves garlic\n- 4 flat-leaf parsley sprigs\n- 3 fresh thyme sprigs (optional)\n- 1 bay leaf\n\n## Instructions  \n1. Combine all ingredients in a stovetop or electric pressure cooker and cover with cold water, about 2 quarts (1.9L). Make sure not to let liquid exceed the cooker's max-fill line; it's okay if a few things poke above the water's surface.\n1. Close cooker and bring to high pressure, then cook at high pressure for 45 minutes. Allow cooker to depressurize, either by allowing it to cool to room temperature (for the clearest stock) or by using the pressure-release valve on the cooker to rapidly vent steam. (Using the release valve will cause the stock to boil, which may result in some loss of clarity; this should not be an issue unless you're serving it as consomm\u00e9 or in another preparation that requires the broth to be crystal-clear.)\n1. Skim fat from stock, strain, then use as desired or freeze for up to 6 months.\n\n[Click here to view, print or save a simplified copy of this Pressure Cooker Chicken Stock Recipe recipe](https://www.getrecipecart.com/recipe/5fa83107aa4340fbd9fe3144)"

Because of this 'repulsive force', a droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with the hot surface.  \n\nThis is most commonly seen when cooking, when a few drops of water are sprinkled in a hot pan.  If the pan's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, which is approximately 193 \u00b0C (379 \u00b0F) for water, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than it would take if the water droplets had been sprinkled into a cooler pan.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/blackmagicfuckery/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

            "There are few things that can help differentiate between cottonmouths (*A. piscivorus*, *A. conanti*) and harmless water snakes (*Nerodia* spp.) once you learn to recognize them properly.  It's important to try to **apply as many keys as possible**; the more of these characteristics you can accurately identify, the more reliable your ID will be.  Underlined text links to pictures to help illustrate the keys.\n\n1. Cottonmouths have a prominent, angular ridge along the top of the head, starting around the supraocular scale (directly above the eye) and running forward toward the snout ([side view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/francisg/781633459/), [front view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfc_pcola/46159931261/)).  This ridge protrudes outward, partially overhanging the eye like a brow, and gives the snake an annoyed or [grumpy looking appearance](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21784039).  This also partially obscures the eyes when viewed [from above](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlyn_nature/11922670356/).  In water snakes, the supraocular scale does not overhang the eye, giving the animal a 'derpy' appearance [from the side](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdrimagestore/19767032301/) or [head on](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/31181955), and allows you to see most of the eye [from above](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/49688336).\n\n2. Cottonmouths have white or cream colored horizontal stripes or lines that run from [below the eye toward the corner of the mouth](https://www.flickr.com/photos/31766129@N08/38793934210/), and often another that runs from [behind the top of the eye toward the point of the jaw](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mirarr/32197116634/).  Water snakes do not.\n\n3. Water snakes usually have [dark, vertical bars](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42389547@N00/4690698138/in/photolist-89v48Q-85DUpz) along the [edges of their labial scales](https://www.flickr.com/photos/144305930@N07/48800934783/).  Cottonmouths do not.\n\n4. Cottonmouths and water snakes both darken with age, and the pattern is often obscured by the time they reach adulthood.  When the dorsolateral pattern IS visible, cottonmouths have bands that are usually wider at the bottom than on top; like pyramids in [side view](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50503400), or hourglasses [from above](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5477628).  In some individuals, the bands might be [broken](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/20863027) or [incomplete](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/43217641), so this is not 100% diagnostic, but is still useful when used in conjunction with the other keys.  Water snakes exhibit a wide variety of patterns; most species aren't banded at all, and the ones that are banded have bands that are wider at the top, like [upside down triangles](https://www.flickr.com/photos/57809070@N03/10789857605/).\n\n5. Adult cottonmouths often have a [noticeable dorsal ridge](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/41856310) along the vertebrae. This gives the body a [triangular appearance](https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewtheus/11110609634/in/photostream/) in cross-section, which is especially noticeable in [underweight](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/20202718) or dehydrated animals, or when they initiate a [defensive display](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42272247@N07/21578345566/).  Water snakes, by contrast, are more cylindrical in cross-section.\n\n6. Baby cottonmouths are born with [yellow or greenish tail tips](https://www.flickr.com/photos/josiah_townsend/4385588894/in/photostream/) (used to lure small prey) that fade as they age.  Young water snakes do not have these ([baby *N. sipedon*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/41710899@N08/8760068810/), [baby *N. rhombifer*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkory/30707198771/in/photostream/) for comparison).\n\n7. Adult water snakes are fairly heavy-bodied, but cottonmouths of similar length tend to be significantly stouter. /n/n There are also some notable behavioral differences.  Water snakes often bask in branches and bushes overhanging water; this is uncommon in cottonmouths.  It is also true that water snakes often swim with the [body partially submerged](https://www.flickr.com/photos/100108154@N02/25613846737/), while cottonmouths usually swim with the [head held high and much of the body above the water line](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50503400), but you can't rely on this characteristic alone; **each are fully capable of swimming the other way** and sometimes do so.  Water snakes are more likely than cottonmouths to dive underwater to escape danger.  When approached, water snakes are more likely to rapidly flee, whereas cottonmouths are more likely to slowly crawl away or simply stay still and hope not to be noticed.  If approached closely or cornered, water snakes are more likely to [flatten out their heads](https://www.flickr.com/photos/usfws_pacificsw/27564085765/in/photostream/) and/or [bodies](https://www.flickr.com/photos/91005472@N07/8494553139/) to appear larger and/or strike in the general direction of the person/animal they are cornered by, hoping to create enough space to escape.  Cottonmouths, on the other hand, are more likely to tilt their heads back (to a near vertical angle) and gape their mouths open, [displaying the white lining of the mouth](https://www.flickr.com/photos/169268909@N03/45916257755/) as a threat display, and vibrate their tails.\n\nBonus: two separate sets of cottonmouths [preying upon water snakes](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/44447911) that allow direct comparisons between [similarly sized animals](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/45546782), plus a picture of a [juvenile cottonmouth (bottom left)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkory/6661143685/) with a juvenile common water snake (top) and a juvenile plain-bellied water snake (bottom right).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*I am a bot created for /r/whatsthissnake, /r/snakes and /r/herpetology to help with snake identification and natural history education.

            "Snakes undergo a process called shedding or 'ecdysis' where old skin is shed in favor of a new, fresh layer of scales. During this process the old skin becomes dull, the belly may turn pink, and the eyes turn mostly opaque blue due to a build-up of fluid between the old and new spectacle. A few days before the skin is physically sloughed, the eyes become clear. When it comes time to shed, the snake will push or rub up against objects in the environment to hook the old skin on something and unroll it off of them like taking off a sock.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*I am a bot created for /r/whatsthissnake, /r/snakes and /r/herpetology to help with snake identification and natural history education.

            "\nTable of Questions and Answers. Original answer linked - Please upvote the original questions and answers.\n***\n\nQuestion | Answer | Link\n---------|----------|----------|\nHave you seen any escorts more than one?|Yes. 65 is the actual number of women. If you counted how many times I have used their services it would be in the 200 range.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzolrrr/)\nDid you go raw with any escorts?|Only with two. One just hopped on and grinded on me. My penis ended up going in her. I came in her twice but we kept going. I get tested every other week.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzoltuu/)\nWhat\u2019s the most and least amount of money you have paid for one escort?|Most:1000 US Least: 150 US|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzolwce/)\nWhat is the sketchiest situation you have found yourself in? Also what is the worst experience you have had?|Meeting up with a girl at a hot tub place. I had to go grab 50 more dollars from an atm. She told me to hurry back or her PIMP might get mad at her. I\u2019ve also been to some motel rooms that were trap houses.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzonn83/)\nHow do you know they're not cops setting you up? My buddy got arrested on vacation in FL for getting one to his hotel room, but I've been thinking it's not such a bad idea lately.|It\u2019s word of mouth. Basically you go through a process and the legit escorts make you get some references from other escorts. If it all checks out then you\u2019re all good. Recently they\u2019ve been busting escorts but the cops can\u2019t have a legit case because the undercover gets tempted to receive a back rub or something else, sometimes even before money is exchanged.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzooj5c/)\nWhy escorts not women you don't pay|Can you rephrase your question?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzoqde0/)\nWhy do you choose women you pay, rather than having encounters with women for free|I ask myself that question all the time. I don\u2019t like commitments and I love the thrill. But I am definitely trying my best to stop. Even though I am wealthy, it\u2019s affecting my mental health.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzoqo9w/)\nWhat was your favourite tv show as a child|Power Rangers|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzokpiv/)\nWhat was your most memorable experience?|I have two. The most memorable experience was probably with a Latina. She had the best head game, grinded in me with no condom and let me cum in her twice. I booked her for 2 hours but we spent 3 and a half together in bed. We cuddled and talked for an hour. She also blew me while we cuddled.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzolye9/)\nHave you been with any famous pornstars?|No I have not. But if you go to LA there are some who escort.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzooub1/)\nHow many have you done anal with?|One. With a condom.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzoow0u/)\nHave you ever met up with an escort and backed out because she wasn\u2019t what you were expecting?|No I have never done that. I have even had sex with a 300 pound girl who I did not find attractive. Not because of her weight but her face. I just did it anyways since she looked like she needed the money.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzor1a7/)\nWhen\u2019s the last time you were with an escort?|2 weeks ago|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzor35i/)\nIs there an escort that you\u2019d like to have sex with but she\u2019s too expensive?|Yes, there\u2019s one that does not give blow jobs and it\u2019s not very intimate. However she is extremely beautiful.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzor6oe/)\nWhere do you find your escorts?|I\u2019m going to be honest. You shouldn\u2019t go visit an escort . It\u2019s not healthy both physically and emotionally.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzor8vi/)\nIs prostitution legal or illegal where you live?|Very much illegal|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzor92h/)\nDon't you want someone to love you for you?|Very much so. I suffer from depression. I am just finding it difficult to find women to date. I\u2019ve tried dating apps, met women through friends. I am not a bad looking guy I dunno it\u2019s the story of my life.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzorf3w/)\nHow old were you when you first started to do this?|24 so 4 years|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzotevb/)\nIs that you Chavez?|No|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzotv7i/)\nIs there a really memorable pair of boobs that one of these escorts had?|Yessir|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzox9wf/)\nHow expensive are they?|I already posted that. The prices vary.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzoykz6/)\nWhat country/state do you live in where you see these escorts?|USA and CA|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzp0p9d/)\nHave you felt what you thought was a real connection to an escort, just to get hit by the truth bomb moments later?|No I know it\u2019s all fake. It\u2019s like a drug honestly. It\u2019s for the moment.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzp24sv/)\nWhat is it actually like? I've always wondered how these type of things go. Do you have a decent relationship with the ones you see more than once (the Latina chick for example) and is it akward or does it feel real?|Feels real in the moment but after you come to the realization that it\u2019s all for show. That\u2019s why I hate my life lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzp85l5/)\nWhen did you lose your virginity?|I was molested as a kid.

It would take an entire post to explain, but the simple things are 1. All of our souls are connected 2. Reincarnation is a real thing 3. We choose to incarnate 4. Life is about the love we create and give 5. We come here to learn lessons which advance our souls 6. When we advance enough we will no longer need to incarnate and will remain in the spirit world 7. No religoun in right, but they do have some good teaching (love thy neighbor) 8. Before the big bang there was only 1 soul that soul split itself into billions and trillions of tinier fragments that spreaded outward creating the universe and those tinier fragments eventually became our soul even though the source is still creating souls now 9. Someday all of our souls will be one again 10. Love is the main meaning of life  You of course, do not have to believe this. In fact I don't expect you to, but I've been studying this for months now and whenever I hear about paranormal things I know exactly how to explain it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/hhjch7/im_a_14_year_who_has_brain_cancer_and_is_going_to/fwanbh6/)\nOP I\u2019m so sorry to hear your story.

The biggest dream/goal was to join the military and then create a business.  My biggest regret was not standing up for myself more while in school.

When asked what he would do as president if china took military action against taiwan he stated \"That's something, yeah. I mean, I think we have got to make it clear to countries around the world that we will not sit by and allow invasions to take place. Absolutely.\"",

It also goes over tweets by the niece of kamala harris that were critical of the NFL and of the teams participating in the super bowl.\n\nI have a hard time taking this article seriously since it quotes tweets that read as jokes and even the tweeters said are jokes.

The amendment would have increased warrant requirements for internet search histories and make the FISA system more transparent. Sanders as well as 3 other senators were not present and did not vote on the amendment.\n\nVersions of the bill passed both the senate and house, but they failed to resolve the differences between the bills and was never signed into law. the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020, never went before the president and the laws that it would have renewed expired.

It says that you shouldn't grill because your grill is probably dirty, which is dumb since that shouldn't be a call to stop grilling but to CLEAN YOUR GRILL. It then complains about how its easier to control the temperature with indoor cooking appliances, all this actually tells us is that the writer lacks grilling skills (pathetic). His final (weak) argument is that because the heating element is below the food, it drips as it cooks, causing the flame to flare up.\n\nFirst this complaint fails to understand that the flames flaring up is an integral part of the grilling experience, not some detrimental side effect. When the flames roar that is a signal to you of how juicy your food is thereby whetting your appetite and increasing your appreciation for the food. Secondly it ignores the fact up that the drippings make the fire FLAIR UP, which as we know here on PCM makes the fire BASED, therefore making the food cooked with it even better.\n\nthis has been an impartial summary"

            "Sir have you considered letting our Lord and Savior the Low Self Discharge Nickel Metal Hydride battery into your life?\n\nIf I may read to you from the Book of Eneloop an alkaline battery lives but one life and then it perishes. The lowest of them sometimes die a horrific death before they are even born, spewing forth the white corruption from their coppery tops while they are still wrapped in their transparent swaddling. Some are taken by the devil later in life. These are batteries which you let into the heart of hearts of your most precious electronics only to see your trust betrayed by cells of corrosive hate. The battery which murders its host is truly the most despicable.\n\nThe alkaline battery holds you firmly in its grip. You must pilgrimage to the market and pay tithes. Provide quarter to a phalanx of spares. Be ever diligent to the risk of the vile corruption. As they quickly fade you are attacked by doubts. \"Is it already dying? Can I squeeze a little more from this cell?\" And then when it has given its life of service you must provide a proper funerary ceremony at one of the local churches of disposal.\n\nBut our savior NiMH releases us from this cycle of toil and death! It welcomes you with the promise of eternal rebirth and recharge. Let the higher power into your life. Never will you have to constantly tithe. Never will you have to dress the dead in their body bags. The threat from the ooze of corrosion will recede like a bad dream.\n\nWhere I once kept no less than 40 spare alkalines I need now only have 4 extra rechargeables. Once I was obligated to carry a full gallon of the dead on the ides of every month. Now all of my dead from the past decade have yet to fill a single cup. Fighting the corrosive corruption was a constant battle of attrition that frequently resulted in the loss of the electrical servants in my household. After letting the disciple Eneloop into their hearts there has not been a single casualty among them.\n\nI am a farmer of the sun. Collecting the light and funneling a spirit of charge into these batteries. I am not beholden to resupply and my boondocks are longer thanks to it. What precious little space I have is not occupied by an army of spares. The few coins to my name stay in my pocket instead of being paid to the alkaline merchants.\n\nLet the Eneloop into your life. Be recharged and be reborn\n\n^(BOT IN TRAINING. PM WITH SUGGESTIONS.)",
            "Flashlight Glossary & Information (from the [r/flashlight wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/wiki/index))\nThis is a basic glossary to help users get a quick understanding of:\n\nThrow - is the flashlights ability to project light over a distance.\n\nFlood - is the ability to illuminate a large area, usually at a short distance (flood and throw are generally used as opposites to one another)\n\nLumens - is the measure of total light produced by the flashlight. For an official measurement a flashlight is shone into an integrating sphere where the light can spread, stopping any directional bias from the lens.\n\nTail stand - is the ability for a flashlight to stand vertically on its end with the lens facing upwards\n\nLux - is used to measure illuminance - a measure of how much visible light is spread over a given area. Lux will change whether the measurement has been taken in the hot-spot or spill of the emitted light. This measurement is particularly biased, as there are no standardised flashlight lux tests.\n\nDrop in - is where parts of a flashlight can be easily replaced in order to upgrade or modify the light. Many brands have a base model that can be \u201cupgraded\u201d with more features when more funds are available. This is also quite useful when part of the torch is damaged and needs to be replaced.\n\nTactical - is a marketing term used to describe a flashlight with features which may be useful for law enforcement etc. Tactical flashlight usually have simple operation, a forward clicky, strobe light, gun mounts, durability etc.\n\nCandle - is used to describe a flashlight that has 360 degrees of visible light around the flashlight. Popular models such as the Maglite allow this to be done by removing the head of the flashlight completely to expose the bulb.\n\nHot Spot - is the central, most intense part of the flashlight beam.\n\nSpill - is the area of light emitted outside the hot-spot of the flashlight beam.\n\nForward Clicky - is a switch that is on when the button is pushed, however locks on when the button is completely pushed in. To turn the flashlight off you need to press, then depress the button completely.\n\nEDC- Acronym that stands for \"Every Day Carry\".\n\n^(BOT IN TRAINING. PM WITH SUGGESTIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS.

Supporters of the visas say they gave Haitians a rare opportunity to work legally in the United States, contribute to the U.S. economy, and help fund the recovery of Haiti after the earthquake, which killed more than 200,000 people.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/7r6hhv/trump_administration_bars_haitians_from_us_visas/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~284050 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Haitian**^#1 **visa**^#2 **work**^#3 **State**^#4 **United**^#5",
