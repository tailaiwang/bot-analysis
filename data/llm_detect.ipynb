Most of the humor in Soviet Russia was quite explicit and often meant something derogatory, such as \"he stupidly thinks he is going to give up his business\". \\n\\nIn addition to the Russian humor, many of the Russians also used \"fool\" to mean \"joke\" or \"joke\" to mean \"joke\" and \"joke\" to mean \"joke\" and \"joke\" to mean \"joke\" and \"joke\" to mean \"joke\".'), Comment(id='frxjoya', text='Well, it originated from the term \"nigger whore\", and while in the early 20th century it was just a slang term, it really took off in the 1920s in the wake of the black civil rights movement.\\n\\nIt was used as a term of endearment.  In the 1950s it was used as an insult, especially after the movie \"Birth of a Nation\" was released in the early 40s.  It was also used as a term of derision to describe a black person.  These all came after the American Civil War, so it\\'s not like the usage really came from the antebellum period.\\n\\nThe etymology is still obscure to me.  I\\'m sure someone else can chime in with more information, though.')]),\n",

Often you will see a tree lose a major limb or leader through weather-related events, the damage from which the tree is unable to compartmentalize before decay or other disease sets in.\\n\\nI work as an arborist and one of the important things we stress is making proper collar cuts when pruning because if you cut to closely to the trunk then it \"breaks\" the 4th wall severely inhibiting the tree\\'s ability to compartmentalize. \\n\\n[Here](https://agrilife.org/treecarekit/files/2013/02/3.6_2.jpg) is a good diagram of what a good collar cut should look like with the cut at a roughly 45° angle just below the branch-bark ridge. A proper cut should soon see a [ring around the cut](https://www.dirtdoctor.com/www/default/ckfinder/userfiles/1114/images/Newsletter%20photos/6.15.17%20-%20Pruning/010b_Proper_pruning_cuts_will_be_almost_perfectly_round_and_the_healing_callus_formation_will_be_uniform_all_around.jpg) in a couple years where the tree is compartmentalizing over the wound, however on larger limbs especially those on slow-growing trees like beeches it may take decades for the tree to compartmentalize the wound leaving the tree vulnerable to decay and disease. \\n\\nIf you cut to close to the trunk, known as a flush cut, it breaks the 4th wall and you don\\'t see that ring of healing around the wound. [In this picture](http://statebystategardening.com/images/uploads/article_uploads/13Jan_umwnews_1-H2.jpg) the lower cut was a flush-cut as you can see there is no compartmentalization on the lower part of the cut so this wound will take significantly longer to heal as it would need to grow from the top down rather than from the outer ring inward. You can also see on the smaller cut above that the 4th wall was broken ever-so-slightly which creates that point on the bottom of the ring. \\n\\nLastly it is also important to not cut the limb to far from the collar [because that leaves a stub](https://www.todayshomeowner.com/images/article/how-to-trim-large-tree-branches-5.jpg) which will never properly compartmentalize either due to the amount of time it would take for  the new growth to completely envelope that old wood. This can lead to decay and disease travelling down the dead wood into the heart of the tree and compromise the interior heartwood often leading to the hollow interior which /u/NatDPP alluded to.\\n\\nIt is also important to note that different trees grow at different rates so the way in which a fast-growing tree like a river birch responds to pruning and injury is very different from the way a slow-growing tree such as a beech does. So sometimes a tree may die from injury due to old age that would have otherwise lived another 50 or 100 years if it had remained unharmed. \\n\\nTrees also eventually slow down in the rate at which they put on new growth which affects their ability to compartmentalize as well. A good indicator for this is the bark which exfoliates in a similar fashion to human skin. If a tree is covered in moss or lichen it is usually an indicator that the bark is not exfoliating very quickly. While it is correct that trees grow faster as they age that is largely due to the nature of how trees grow. As the limbs grow larger and larger adding an additional 1/4\" of growth to the diameter of a limb that is 2\" in diameter will add less wood than that same limb 20 years later when it is 8\" in diameter.\\n\\nI also feel I should put this disclaimer that I never went to school for this so if there is an arborculturalist that has a more precise definition or explanation for these things I am more than welcoming of those corrections.'), Comment(id='hihhgoi', text=\"It's ok Belichick currently has 283 career regular season wins\")]),\n",

Not only that, but they actually let you decide what to send to him.\\n\\nWhat you send is....\\n\\n1. A bag full of the worst American candy\\n2. Radioactive Material\\n3. A box of Topeka\\'s #1 export\\n4. Multilevel marketing pamphlets\\n\\n**You chose \"Multilevel marketing pamphlets\"**\\n\\n\\nIt’s sleazy and amoral, but if you can get Jong-un on board, you can make a fortune bringing MLMs to the North Korean marketplace. Who’s going to say “no” when Beloved Father gives them your sales pitch? \\n\\nYou send your package and cross your fingers. Jong-un opens the package live on YouTube, reads through your brochure, and his eyes light up at the promise of this revolutionary new product: KimjongGreen. (Ok, ok, so maybe it’s just powdered oregano and matcha. And only trace amounts of radium. Allegedly.) \\n\\nWithin three months, the entire North Korean economy—which was already on shaky ground--revolves around buying, selling, and consuming KimjongGreen. At the top of the pyramid, you’re raking in the cheddar. You can even afford a Scrooge McDuck-style pool to swim in your cash. \\n\\nThe same day you buy your third Maserati—you needed several colors to match your outfits—news reports start rolling in of advancing North Korean troops across multiple continents. \\n\\nIt turns out KimjongGreen was not the quack supplement you thought! In fact, it gave the North Koreans superhuman abilities; growing twice the height of average humans with four times the strength. Individual soldiers gain the capacity to take on Panther tanks singlehandedly. Harnessing this new strength, they quickly overtake the rest of the planet. \\n\\nRespected Comrade Kim Jong-un personally marches to your mansion. You quake in fear as the hulking supplement-boosted dictator elevates you to a place of honor within his government—by literally lifting you on his shoulder.

Before I had a Drip Squad Avatar, I did not know how to program. \\n\\nThe journey and growth and effort to create dripbot was long, it was not just a program being made but a part of myself. I wanted to ensure everyone got good information about their avatar. Dripbot was originally commissioned by me, and paid for in ETH. And after several rewrites, I had created a suitable FlairBot with additional functionalities for my subs. The original commissioned program basically had every line been rewrote multiple times by myself, and thousands of extra lines put into it, it’s entire workings are completely different now. \\n\\n\\nAvatartrading was obviously a goal of mine, they are the biggest sub in the space. As he was up on some subs before this, notably r/DripSquadNFT thus Dripbot. \\n\\nThe deployment to avatar trading of dripbot did have it problems, and during the deployment there were frustrated interaction with the avatartrading mod team and my self, I admit I was not the being best version of myself. (Deployment to avatartrading was stressful on me, but that’s no excuse.)\\n\\nAfter a while I had believed I fixed all the issues facing the mod team. The last time a mod of avatar trading contacted me was Jan 6, and there was a typo mistake which I fixed and check to see if it worked. And I haven’t heard anything at all since then, and not much much before then. \\n\\nIf the mod team of avatar trading wanted additional functions, fix problem they were facing, and/or make a robust flair system, they would have need to have *a discussion* about what that system looked like with the me, the developer. I can’t read your minds, and some functions would have to be done in a specific way to work. \\n\\nNo discussion ever happened, so I ran the server and went on to different projects.\\n\\nRecently, I’ve circled back for additional functionality’s for dripbot’s future. And there is a huge rewrite going on, recreating the program to be more readable and editable, and optimized. This means the current running version hasn’t been changed at all in quite a while. I was in no rush for this rewrite to finish, I had other projects, thinking dripbot was running mostly smoothly, especially after I update the blank flair fix…a month or so ago. Sometimes he still crashes…idk what to tell you. \\n\\nI was providing this service free of charge, however dripbot’s creation and usage was not and is not a free thing. My work and my time, I have a full time job, I run other subreddits and communities, I don’t have unlimited time. And my interests are more involved with web3 aspects of programming, and not just Reddit avatars. \\n\\nDripbot was not made for avatartrading, they were added to a system involving multiple subreddits, as I believed the functionality would be a great benefit to their community. I was never a real mod of avatartrading, and simply had the required permission to do the flair functions, and ran the server on my dime. They joined my system, I didn’t join theirs. \\n \\nThis removal was not my decision and I had as little warning about it as all of you. As in, I was told it happened a few hours after it happened, in my discord server, by one of my mod team. But I was already aware by then. \\n\\nI was completely blindsided. \\n\\nTo this day, there has never been a group chat or any in depth discussion about dripbot’s problems with me, so frankly I was unaware of any real issues besides some bugs I was planning on fixing in the rewrite. And thoughts of improvement *for them* simply were never asked for, or were already implemented in some way, there were and are multiple ways to stop dripbot from working on specific users that were available, including personalized editable flair (using the correct flair class, you can’t just make a new one) and setting your profile to NSFW (anyone can do this). You could have used dripbot keep, then edited that flair as a mod, you can do that to someone else that has a “keep” flair. So arguments about it didn’t and doesn’t do that are false. Creating a complete username override has to be written into the program by me, as the program doesn’t store you usernames or avatars, everyone on the mod team that asked for that got it. (When I asked for a list of mods that wanted that, I received no such list.)\\n\\nAnd maybe all of this could have been better explained if I was ever brought into a full discussion with the mod team at any point. But that’s not my place, I don’t know how it work internally over there, I just make bots that say cone.\\n\\nYou can always message the bot directly. As many user have, and most of the time I’ve been able to resolve their problems. \\n\\nBut, respectfully, please, take my name off this daily post. It makes me and you look bad having it up there.

He was carrying a baby on his back. In those days in Japan, we often saw children playing with their little brothers or sisters on their backs, but this boy was clearly different. I could see that he had come to this place for a serious reason. He was wearing no shoes. His face was hard. The little head was tipped back as if the baby were fast asleep. The boy stood there for five or ten minutes”.\\n\\n> “The men in white masks walked over to him and quietly began to take off the rope that was holding the baby. That is when I saw that the baby was already dead. The men held the body by the hands and feet and placed it on the fire. The boy stood there straight without moving, watching the flames. He was biting his lower lip so hard that it shone with blood. The flame burned low like the sun going down. The boy turned around and walked silently away”.\"), Comment(id='e7sxmq9', text='Per [here](https://www.aviation24.be/airlines/ryanair/hurricane-leslie-800-passengers-crews-stranded-malaga-airport/):\\n\\n> 15 October 2018\\n\\n> On Saturday night, Ryanair ops couldn’t immediately provide accommodation for the stranded crews as – according to Ryanair COO Peter Bellew – all hotels in Malaga were completely booked.\\n\\n> The crew – already at odds with their management – was forced to sleep on the crew room floor and decided to take a picture. Peter Bellew tweeted that the crew didn’t spend the entire night on that floor but was offered an access to the VIP lounge of Malaga airport: “The storm created huge damage in Portugal. Later after this the crew moved to VIP lounge. Apologies to the crew we could not find accommodation”. \\n\\n> But that information is not true as Alex Macheras discovered: “I’ve spoken to the ‘SALA VIP’ lounge at Malaga Airport, the only lounge in the terminal, who confirmed no crew from any airline entered the lounge, and not only described it as “against lounge policy” but added “it’s also impossible, as our lounge closes at 23:00 each night, and this was the case on the night of flight disruption caused by the storms”.\\n\\n> “There are at least 400 hotels in and around the main city of Malaga, City, with a further 1,500 properties within 20 kilometres of the airport. Furthermore, it’s low-season in Southern Spain, and most hotel occupancy rates are at 50% (half-empty) as is normal for this time of year. Hence the statement of Peter Bellew is simply not the truth, nor the reality in Malaga“, Alex Macheras commented.\\n\\n[Credit](https://www.radarbox24.com/news/a-ryanair-crew-had-to-sleep-on-briefing-rooms-floor-in-malaga-airport) to the photographer, Jim Atkinson.'), Comment(id='fb8qxkg', text='[Here](https://i.imgur.com/2xoKEOI.jpg?desktop=1) is a higher quality and less cropped version of this image.

Per the source (which has more pictures of this lion):\\n\\n> We decided to try an area where we found a small herd of elephants the day before that was near a watering hole called Rabelias Dam near Orpen Camp. Upon arriving we notice a large male lion crouching on the shore.\\n\\n> As our cameras clicked away you could see something was off, his posture just did not look right. On closer examination looking through the lens his left hind leg was protruding and at a strange angle. After he had his fill of water he struggled to his feet hardly able to stand. What you did not notice while he was drinking, he literally was nothing but skin and bones.\\n\\n> He slowly moved away from the water and staggered as if he was drunk towards a small rise. Every few steps he would stop to catch his breath, his head hanging low until he had enough energy to take a few more steps. Upon reaching the rise he turned to face the water hole and began his slow descent to the ground. About half way down he collapsed the rest of the way. It was evident he was in his last days if not his last hours on this earth.\\n\\n> As we continued to watch this once beautiful and strong lion a small herd of elephants arrived at the waters edge. The elephants drank, played squirting water into the air over themselves and others to cool down from the days heat.\\n\\n> One of the larger elephants left the others and walked towards the rise not far from where the lion had collapsed as if to stand guard over the herd. At first he did not notice the lion lying low in the grass about 30 yards away trying to stay out of sight.\\n\\n> Then in an instant the elephant reared, ears outstretched and flapping as he took several steps back, trumpeted and charged the lion. Upon hearing the elephant start his charge all the other elephants started to charge as well, trunks in the air trumpeting as the ran towards the lion.\\n\\n> Maybe in his younger more virile days the lion would have tried to make a stand, at least roar at the top of his lungs. But not now, now it took every bit of energy he had to get to his feet turn and run.\\n\\n> After everything settled down Greg and I drove to find the lion. We found him lying in the grass, exhausted unable to move. We were no more then five feet from him as he lay dying in the shade of a tree. Dropping my camera we stared at one another locking eyes for what seemed for an eternity. I just wanted him to know that he would not die alone as he struggled to breath, his chest rising only every so often. Then a last twitch of an ear, his last breath, he was gone. The King was dead.\\n\\n> Over the years as a photojournalist I have photographed people that had lost everything in earthquakes, fires and landslides, people that had been injured, people that were dying but I have never photographed anything as sad as this majestic animal, the true king of the beasts and master of his domain. I will never forget what I was so privileged to have witnessed.\\n\\n> Later we learned that the name of this noble lion was Skybed Scar. The lion was well known in the Kruger National Park where he roamed and ruled for many years. He lived free and he died free.'), Comment(id='e149ee2', text='[Here](https://i.imgur.com/KTraTEl.jpg) is a significantly higher resolution version of this image.

She's an absolutely relentless content creator: **Of all 58 Hololive members and affiliated channels, only Roboco and Fubuki have produced more individual pieces of content than her!** This girl *works so hard* and had her *best year in 2020 despite* **mountains** *of adversity!*\\n\\nShe's an inspiration to me, and hundreds of thousands of others.

She is the first in the fourth generation to reach this mark, gaining 100,000 subscribers since January 11. (36 days ago) She is also the **fastest Japanese talent in Hololive history** to 1,000,000 subscribers, besting Pekora's record by 91 days (415 vs. 506).\\n\\nLet's put this in terms everyone can understand: **NO ONE** in Hololive has done more to expand Hololive to the international audience than Coco has. Possessing fluency in Japanese and English, and using it to promote her genmates and herself, Coco is owed a debt of gratitude by every rabbit hole veteran.\\n\\nCoco is the persevering heart of Hololive. 2020 was a year of incredible highs and disquieting lows for her. From demonetization to suspension to the ongoing anti situation, she has done her utmost to keep a positive face on it all. She busted her dragon ass to get to this point. She remains the ace of fourth generation with incredible Superchat income, rock-solid viewership no matter what content she's doing, and now joins the million-subscriber sisterhood.\\n\\nNothing can bring her down, nothing can break her. She's an inspiration for anyone who's ever been punished unjustly for something they never meant to do. She's still up there, making us laugh with memes, serving as the inspiration for hundreds of r/Hololive inside jokes, ~~and tonight she will take the stage with most of her senpai for the first time.~~ I look forward to continuing to cheer her on.\\n\\n**Popular Coco content since her last milestone**\\n\\n* [Coco and Kanata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttpZLc7vQs) [in front of a green screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuxQqgJnk4g) has been kinda the theme of 2021 so far\\n\\n* Remember that time she [freaked the faq out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-fLdKyvts) at a Minecraft villager?\\n\\n**Congratulations, Kaichou! You absolutely deserve this! The gold play button is going to look great in that zatsudan room!** 🐲\\n\\n(Edit: I mistakenly believed that Coco would be on stage for the Bloom, concert.

New England linebackers coach Brian Flores interviewed with the Cardinals on Saturday, and Caserio and Ossenfort also are in demand in what amounts to an unresolved situation until the Texans fill their general manager job.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nLast year, the Patriots allowed Caserio to talk with the 49ers, but this year the same opportunity was not given to Houston.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nBut new rules implemented by the NFL last offseason will give Caserio and other front-office executives some flexibility. In past years, certain teams blocked other teams from interviewing key front-office executives by saying that the individual had final say on the 53-man roster.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nThe exact language from the NFL\\'s anti-tampering policy reads as follows: \"Final authority regarding the composition of the 53-player roster is not a requirement.\"  \\n&nbsp;  \\nThe Texans are seeking a new GM after Rick Smith announced last weekend that he will take an extended leave of absence from the team to help care for his wife while she battles breast cancer.  \\n&nbsp;  \\n**Join the resistance, don\\'t give ESPN your clicks!  \\n&nbsp;  \\n --Love Fuck_ESPN_Bot**'), Comment(id='dtvyxqp', text='**Tuesday morning meeting with Bill Belichick convinced Josh McDaniels to change his mind**  \\nBy Mike Reiss  \\n&nbsp;  \\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels arrived at Gillette Stadium on Tuesday with the intention of cleaning out his office to become the Indianapolis Colts head coach, but Patriots head coach Bill Belichick\\'s willingness to take his mentorship to a higher level played a significant part in McDaniels reversing course, sources told ESPN.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nBelichick told McDaniels that he would spend more time with him on the inner workings of the Patriots, including roster construction and salary-cap management, which was viewed as \"extremely valuable\" to McDaniels. It is an arrangement that owners Robert and Jonathan Kraft endorsed because it could ultimately be part of a succession plan for Belichick in the future, although no assurances were made to McDaniels.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nAnother part of the Patriots\\' sales pitch that swayed McDaniels, per sources, was a long-term contractual commitment that would give McDaniels\\' four children, who are ages 12, 10, 6 and 3, the chance to stay in the same school system for an extended period of time. McDaniels has told those close to him that such stability is rare in the coaching profession, and is something he values.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nAs of Tuesday morning, McDaniels was still prepared to take the Colts\\' job. Ultimately, the conversations with the Krafts and Belichick changed his mind, as it was new information for him to evaluate. Had he had that information prior to the interview process, the way McDaniels approached interviews for head-coaching vacancies in January likely would have changed.  \\n&nbsp;  \\n**Join the resistance, don\\'t give ESPN your clicks!  \\n&nbsp;  \\n --Love Fuck_ESPN_Bot**'), Comment(id='dprgph5', text=\"**Stephon Gilmore: 'I've never been 7-2 in this league; it's crazy'**  \\nBy Mike Reiss  \\n&nbsp;  \\nDENVER -- Stephon Gilmore’s smile was hard to miss.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nIt was late Sunday night following the New England Patriots’ 41-16 victory over the Denver Broncos, and Gilmore had multiple reasons to feel good as he departed Sports Authority Field.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nFirst, the team he plays for is rolling.  \\n&nbsp;  \\n“I’ve never been 7-2 in this league. It’s crazy,” he said, a reference to his previous five years with the Buffalo Bills. “Oh man, we just have to keep it going. I haven’t won in my whole NFL career, so it feels good.”  \\n&nbsp;  \\nSecond, he played a significant role in the win, reclaiming his starting spot from Johnson Bademosi after missing the last three games with a concussion.  \\n&nbsp;  \\n“It felt good. The injury I had, it was a little frustrating, a concussion. I thank God that He healed me and I was able to come back and take off where I left it and play confident.”  \\n&nbsp;  \\nWhether Gilmore would have that opportunity made for some spirited debate over the past month, as Bademosi had filled in admirably and the defense had taken obvious strides without Gilmore. But coordinator Matt Patricia couldn’t have been more decisive with Gilmore on Sunday night, lining him up at left cornerback and never taking him off the field -- just like he did against the Buccaneers on Oct. 5, which was arguably Gilmore's best game.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nAn early pass breakup helped get Gilmore going Sunday night, and while he was penalized for defensive holding to negate a third-down stop and also was closest in coverage on a touchdown pass, he was mostly solid.  \\n&nbsp;  \\nGilmore relayed that the Patriots’ plan was to have him on Demaryius Thomas and fellow cornerback Malcolm Butler on Emmanuel Sanders, which was similar to what the team did against the Buccaneers by matching Gilmore up with Mike Evans and Butler with DeSean Jackson.  \\n&nbsp;  \\n“We studied those guys and knew the majority of their routes,” he said of the Broncos' top wide receiver duo. “They switched some stuff up, but at the end of the day, we came out with the win so I was happy.”  \\n&nbsp;  \\nThose smiles had been harder to come by when he was out with the concussion.  \\n&nbsp;  \\n“I just listened to the doctors. They helped me out a lot. I just had to rest,” he said. “The only thing I didn’t like was that I couldn’t practice a couple days. I’m the type of person that likes to practice and work on my technique, but I felt like I played [well]. To miss a couple days, I was just blessed to be healthy again. \\x85  \\n&nbsp;  \\n“You just never know with those injuries. You just have to be careful, listen to the doctors, and be honest. I feel good now, so that’s a good thing.”  \\n&nbsp;  \\n**Join the resistance, don't give ESPN your clicks!  \\n&nbsp;  \\n --Love Fuck_ESPN_Bot**\")]),\n",

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook according to package directions until a little under al dente, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Set aside.\\n1. In a large bowl, whisk milk and eggs. Add cooked macaroni, 2 cups extra-sharp Cheddar, melted butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and stir until well combined.\\n1. Add half the macaroni mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish in an even layer. Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups Colby Jack evenly on top. Spread the remaining macaroni mixture on top in an even layer. Cover with aluminum foil, transfer to the middle rack of the oven and bake for 30 minutes.\\n1. Remove from oven. Carefully remove and discard the aluminum foil. Top the macaroni mixture with the remaining 2 cups Cheddar and 1/2 cup Colby Jack. Broil on top rack until cheese is browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. (The broiled cheese can go from golden to burnt fairly quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)\\n1. Remove from oven and let cool until the macaroni and cheese is fully set, 10 to 15 minutes. (The mixture may first appear jiggly, but it will firm up as it cools.)

Close cooker and bring to high pressure, then cook at high pressure for 45 minutes. Allow cooker to depressurize, either by allowing it to cool to room temperature (for the clearest stock) or by using the pressure-release valve on the cooker to rapidly vent steam. (Using the release valve will cause the stock to boil, which may result in some loss of clarity; this should not be an issue unless you're serving it as consommé or in another preparation that requires the broth to be crystal-clear.)\\n1.

It's important to try to **apply as many keys as possible**; the more of these characteristics you can accurately identify, the more reliable your ID will be.  Underlined text links to pictures to help illustrate the keys.\\n\\n1. Cottonmouths have a prominent, angular ridge along the top of the head, starting around the supraocular scale (directly above the eye) and running forward toward the snout ([side view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/francisg/781633459/), [front view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfc_pcola/46159931261/)).  This ridge protrudes outward, partially overhanging the eye like a brow, and gives the snake an annoyed or [grumpy looking appearance](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21784039).  This also partially obscures the eyes when viewed [from above](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlyn_nature/11922670356/).  In water snakes, the supraocular scale does not overhang the eye, giving the animal a 'derpy' appearance [from the side](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdrimagestore/19767032301/) or [head on](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/31181955), and allows you to see most of the eye [from above](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/49688336).\\n\\n2. Cottonmouths have white or cream colored horizontal stripes or lines that run from [below the eye toward the corner of the mouth](https://www.flickr.com/photos/31766129@N08/38793934210/), and often another that runs from [behind the top of the eye toward the point of the jaw](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mirarr/32197116634/).  Water snakes do not.\\n\\n3. Water snakes usually have [dark, vertical bars](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42389547@N00/4690698138/in/photolist-89v48Q-85DUpz) along the [edges of their labial scales](https://www.flickr.com/photos/144305930@N07/48800934783/).  Cottonmouths do not.\\n\\n4. Cottonmouths and water snakes both darken with age, and the pattern is often obscured by the time they reach adulthood.  When the dorsolateral pattern IS visible, cottonmouths have bands that are usually wider at the bottom than on top; like pyramids in [side view](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50503400), or hourglasses [from above](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5477628).  In some individuals, the bands might be [broken](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/20863027) or [incomplete](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/43217641), so this is not 100% diagnostic, but is still useful when used in conjunction with the other keys.  Water snakes exhibit a wide variety of patterns; most species aren't banded at all, and the ones that are banded have bands that are wider at the top, like [upside down triangles](https://www.flickr.com/photos/57809070@N03/10789857605/).\\n\\n5. Adult cottonmouths often have a [noticeable dorsal ridge](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/41856310) along the vertebrae. This gives the body a [triangular appearance](https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewtheus/11110609634/in/photostream/) in cross-section, which is especially noticeable in [underweight](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/20202718) or dehydrated animals, or when they initiate a [defensive display](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42272247@N07/21578345566/).  Water snakes, by contrast, are more cylindrical in cross-section.\\n\\n6. Baby cottonmouths are born with [yellow or greenish tail tips](https://www.flickr.com/photos/josiah_townsend/4385588894/in/photostream/) (used to lure small prey) that fade as they age.  Young water snakes do not have these ([baby *N. sipedon*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/41710899@N08/8760068810/), [baby *N. rhombifer*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkory/30707198771/in/photostream/) for comparison).\\n\\n7. Adult water snakes are fairly heavy-bodied, but cottonmouths of similar length tend to be significantly stouter. /n/n There are also some notable behavioral differences.  Water snakes often bask in branches and bushes overhanging water; this is uncommon in cottonmouths.  It is also true that water snakes often swim with the [body partially submerged](https://www.flickr.com/photos/100108154@N02/25613846737/), while cottonmouths usually swim with the [head held high and much of the body above the water line](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50503400), but you can't rely on this characteristic alone; **each are fully capable of swimming the other way** and sometimes do so.  Water snakes are more likely than cottonmouths to dive underwater to escape danger.  When approached, water snakes are more likely to rapidly flee, whereas cottonmouths are more likely to slowly crawl away or simply stay still and hope not to be noticed.  If approached closely or cornered, water snakes are more likely to [flatten out their heads](https://www.flickr.com/photos/usfws_pacificsw/27564085765/in/photostream/) and/or [bodies](https://www.flickr.com/photos/91005472@N07/8494553139/) to appear larger and/or strike in the general direction of the person/animal they are cornered by, hoping to create enough space to escape.  Cottonmouths, on the other hand, are more likely to tilt their heads back (to a near vertical angle) and gape their mouths open, [displaying the white lining of the mouth](https://www.flickr.com/photos/169268909@N03/45916257755/) as a threat display, and vibrate their tails.\\n\\nBonus: two separate sets of cottonmouths [preying upon water snakes](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/44447911) that allow direct comparisons between [similarly sized animals](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/45546782), plus a picture of a [juvenile cottonmouth (bottom left)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkory/6661143685/) with a juvenile common water snake (top) and a juvenile plain-bellied water snake (bottom right).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n*I am a bot created for /r/whatsthissnake, /r/snakes and /r/herpetology to help with snake identification and natural history education.

Also what is the worst experience you have had?|Meeting up with a girl at a hot tub place. I had to go grab 50 more dollars from an atm. She told me to hurry back or her PIMP might get mad at her.

My buddy got arrested on vacation in FL for getting one to his hotel room, but I've been thinking it's not such a bad idea lately.|It’s word of mouth. Basically you go through a process and the legit escorts make you get some references from other escorts. If it all checks out then you’re all good. Recently they’ve been busting escorts but the cops can’t have a legit case because the undercover gets tempted to receive a back rub or something else, sometimes even before money is exchanged.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzooj5c/)\\nWhy escorts not women you don't pay|Can you rephrase your question?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/nmhevw/i_am_a_28_m_ive_never_been_in_a_serious/gzoqde0/)\\nWhy do you choose women you pay, rather than having encounters with women for free|I ask myself that question all the time.

Before the big bang there was only 1 soul that soul split itself into billions and trillions of tinier fragments that spreaded outward creating the universe and those tinier fragments eventually became our soul even though the source is still creating souls now 9.

It says that you shouldn't grill because your grill is probably dirty, which is dumb since that shouldn't be a call to stop grilling but to CLEAN YOUR GRILL. It then complains about how its easier to control the temperature with indoor cooking appliances, all this actually tells us is that the writer lacks grilling skills (pathetic). His final (weak) argument is that because the heating element is below the food, it drips as it cooks, causing the flame to flare up.\\n\\nFirst this complaint fails to understand that the flames flaring up is an integral part of the grilling experience, not some detrimental side effect. When the flames roar that is a signal to you of how juicy your food is thereby whetting your appetite and increasing your appreciation for the food. Secondly it ignores the fact up that the drippings make the fire FLAIR UP, which as we know here on PCM makes the fire BASED, therefore making the food cooked with it even better.\\n\\nthis has been an impartial summary\")]),\n",

The battery which murders its host is truly the most despicable.\\n\\nThe alkaline battery holds you firmly in its grip. You must pilgrimage to the market and pay tithes. Provide quarter to a phalanx of spares. Be ever diligent to the risk of the vile corruption. As they quickly fade you are attacked by doubts. \"Is it already dying? Can I squeeze a little more from this cell?\" And then when it has given its life of service you must provide a proper funerary ceremony at one of the local churches of disposal.\\n\\nBut our savior NiMH releases us from this cycle of toil and death! It welcomes you with the promise of eternal rebirth and recharge. Let the higher power into your life. Never will you have to constantly tithe. Never will you have to dress the dead in their body bags. The threat from the ooze of corrosion will recede like a bad dream.\\n\\nWhere I once kept no less than 40 spare alkalines I need now only have 4 extra rechargeables. Once I was obligated to carry a full gallon of the dead on the ides of every month. Now all of my dead from the past decade have yet to fill a single cup. Fighting the corrosive corruption was a constant battle of attrition that frequently resulted in the loss of the electrical servants in my household. After letting the disciple Eneloop into their hearts there has not been a single casualty among them.\\n\\nI am a farmer of the sun. Collecting the light and funneling a spirit of charge into these batteries. I am not beholden to resupply and my boondocks are longer thanks to it. What precious little space I have is not occupied by an army of spares. The few coins to my name stay in my pocket instead of being paid to the alkaline merchants.\\n\\nLet the Eneloop into your life. Be recharged and be reborn\\n\\n^(BOT IN TRAINING.

For an official measurement a flashlight is shone into an integrating sphere where the light can spread, stopping any directional bias from the lens.\\n\\nTail stand - is the ability for a flashlight to stand vertically on its end with the lens facing upwards\\n\\nLux - is used to measure illuminance - a measure of how much visible light is spread over a given area. Lux will change whether the measurement has been taken in the hot-spot or spill of the emitted light. This measurement is particularly biased, as there are no standardised flashlight lux tests.\\n\\nDrop in - is where parts of a flashlight can be easily replaced in order to upgrade or modify the light. Many brands have a base model that can be “upgraded” with more features when more funds are available. This is also quite useful when part of the torch is damaged and needs to be replaced.\\n\\nTactical - is a marketing term used to describe a flashlight with features which may be useful for law enforcement etc. Tactical flashlight usually have simple operation, a forward clicky, strobe light, gun mounts, durability etc.\\n\\nCandle - is used to describe a flashlight that has 360 degrees of visible light around the flashlight. Popular models such as the Maglite allow this to be done by removing the head of the flashlight completely to expose the bulb.\\n\\nHot Spot - is the central, most intense part of the flashlight beam.\\n\\nSpill - is the area of light emitted outside the hot-spot of the flashlight beam.\\n\\nForward Clicky - is a switch that is on when the button is pushed, however locks on when the button is completely pushed in. To turn the flashlight off you need to press, then depress the button completely.\\n\\nEDC- Acronym that stands for \"Every Day Carry\".\\n\\n^(BOT IN TRAINING. PM WITH SUGGESTIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS.
